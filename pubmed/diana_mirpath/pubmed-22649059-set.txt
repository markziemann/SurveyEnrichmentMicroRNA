AB  - Background: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is still one of the types of 
      cancer with the highest death rates. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play essential roles in 
      NSCLC development. This study evaluates miRNA expression patterns and specific 
      mechanisms in male patients with NSCLC. Methods: We report an integrated 
      microarray analysis of miRNAs for eight matched samples of males with NSCLC 
      compared to the study of public datasets of males with NSCLC from TCGA, followed 
      by qRT-PCR validation. Results: For the TCGA dataset, we identified 385 
      overexpressed and 75 underexpressed miRNAs. Our cohort identified 54 
      overexpressed and 77 underexpressed miRNAs, considering a fold-change (FC) of 
      ±1.5 and p < 0.05 as the cutoff value. The common miRNA signature consisted of 
      eight overexpressed and nine underexpressed miRNAs. Validation was performed 
      using qRT-PCR on the tissue samples for miR-183-3p and miR-34c-5p and on plasma 
      samples for miR-34c-5p. We also created mRNA-miRNA regulatory networks to 
      identify critical molecules, revealing NSCLC signaling pathways related to 
      underexpressed and overexpressed transcripts. The genes targeted by these 
      transcripts were correlated with overall survival. Conclusions: miRNAs and some 
      of their target genes could play essential roles in investigating the mechanisms 
      involved in NSCLC evolution and provide opportunities to identify potential 
      therapeutic targets.

TI  - A Proof-of-Concept Analysis of Plasma-Derived Exosomal microRNAs in Interstitial 
      Pulmonary Fibrosis Secondary to Antisynthetase Syndrome.
LID - 10.3390/ijms232314579 [doi]
LID - 14579
AB  - Antisynthetase syndrome (ASSD) is an autoimmune disease characterized by the 
      positivity of autoantibodies against different aminoacyl transfer RNA (tRNA) 
      synthetases. Morbidity and mortality of this disease are highly affected by 
      interstitial lung disease (ILD) which is present in about 80% of patients. In 
      this study, we investigated possible differences in 84 immune-related circulating 
      miRNAs between ASSD patients with and without ILD; we enrolled 15 ASSD patients, 
      11 with ILD (ILD+) and 4 without ILD (ILD-), and 5 patients with idiopathic 
      pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) as an additional control group. All patients were at 
      disease onset and not on therapy at the time of inclusion. Differentially 
      expressed miRNAs were identified in plasma-derived exosomes, using an miRNA PCR 
      array (MIHS-111ZG, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany); miR-30a-5p and miR-29c-3p were 
      upregulated in ASSD-ILD patients compared to patients without lung involvement 
      (adjusted p-value < 0.05). IPF patients showed higher miR-29c-3p expression 
      levels with respect to both ASSD and ASSD-ILD (p = 0.0005), whereas levels of 
      miR-30a-5p were not different. miR-29c-3p and miR-30a-5p are overexpressed in 
      ASSD-ILD+ patients compared with ILD−. These miRNAs are involved in the 
      regulation of inflammation and fibrosis through their action on NF-κB and TGF-β1. 
      Although the mechanistic role of these miRNAs in ASSD-ILD development has to be 
      elucidated, we suggest that their exosome levels could be useful in identifying 
      patients at risk of ILD.

AB  - Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease in which aberrant lipid 
      metabolism plays a key role. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), micro-coordinators of gene 
      expression, have been recently proposed as novel clinical biomarkers and 
      potential therapeutic tools for a broad spectrum of diseases. This study aimed to 
      identify miRNAs with therapeutic potential in atherosclerosis. Bioinformatic 
      databases, including experimentally validated and computational prediction tools 
      as well as a novel combination method, were used to identify miRNAs that are able 
      to simultaneously inhibit key genes related to the pathogenesis of 
      atherosclerosis. Further validation of genes and miRNAs was conducted using the 
      STRING online tool, KEGG pathway analysis and DIANA-miRPath. The inhibitory 
      effects of the identified miRNAs in HepG2 and Huh7 cells were verified by 
      real-time PCR. The MTT assay was utilized to evaluate cell cytotoxicity effects 
      of miRNAs. Atherosclerotic drug-targeted genes were selected as key genes. Strong 
      interactions between genes were confirmed using STRING. These genes were shown to 
      be integral to critical pathological processes involved in atherosclerosis. A 
      novel combined method of validated and predicted tools for the identification of 
      effective miRNAs was defined as the combination score (C-Score). Bioinformatic 
      analysis showed that hsa-miR-124-3p and hsa-miR-16-5p possessed the best C-Score 
      (0.68 and 0.62, respectively). KEGG and DIANA-miRPath analysis showed that 
      selected genes and identified miRNAs were involved in atherosclerosis-related 
      pathways. Compared with the controls in both HepG2 and Huh7 cell lines, miR-124 
      significantly reduced the expression of CETP, PCSK9, MTTP, and APOB, and miR-16 
      significantly reduced the expression of APOCIII, CETP, HMGCR, PCSK9, MTTP, and 
      APOB, respectively. The cytotoxicity assay showed that miR-124 reduced cell 
      viability, especially after 72 h; however, miR-16 did not show any significant 
      cytotoxicity in either cell line. Our findings indicate that hsa-miR-124 and 
      miR-16 have potential for use as therapeutic candidates in the treatment of 
      atherosclerosis.

TI  - Identification of circRNAs Associated with Adipogenesis Based on RNA-seq Data in 
      Pigs.
LID - 10.3390/genes13112062 [doi]
LID - 2062
AB  - Adipocytes or fat cells play a vital role in the storage and release of energy in 
      pigs, and many circular RNAs (circRNAs) have emerged as important regulators in 
      various tissues and cell types in pigs. However, the spatio-temporal expression 
      pattern of circRNAs between different adipose deposition breeds remains elusive. 
      In this study, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) produced transcriptome profiles of 
      Western Landrace (lean-type) and Chinese Songliao black pigs (obese-type) with 
      different thicknesses of subcutaneous fat tissues and were used to identify 
      circRNAs involved in the regulation of adipogenesis. Gene expression analysis 
      revealed 883 circRNAs, among which 26 and 11 circRNAs were differentially 
      expressed between Landrace vs. Songliao pigs and high- vs. low-thickness groups, 
      respectively. We also analyzed the interaction between circRNAs and microRNAs 
      (miRNAs) and constructed their interaction network in adipogenesis; gene ontology 
      classification and pathway analysis revealed two vital circRNAs, with the 
      majority of their target genes enriched in biological functions such as fatty 
      acids biosynthesis, fatty acid metabolism, and Wnt/TGF-β signaling pathways. 
      These candidate circRNAs can be taken as potential targets for further 
      experimental studies. Our results show that circRNAs are dynamically expressed 
      and provide a valuable basis for understanding the molecular mechanism of 
      circRNAs in pig adipose biology.

TI  - Transcriptomics and miRNomics data integration in lymphoblastoid cells highlights 
      the key role of immune-related functions in lithium treatment response in Bipolar 
      disorder.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bipolar Disorder (BD) is a complex mental disease characterized by 
      recurrent episodes of mania and depression. Lithium (Li) represents the mainstay 
      of BD pharmacotherapy, despite the narrow therapeutic index and the high 
      variability in treatment response. However, although several studies have been 
      conducted, the molecular mechanisms underlying Li therapeutic effects remain 
      unclear. METHODS: In order to identify molecular signatures and biological 
      pathways associated with Li treatment response, we conducted transcriptome and 
      miRNome microarray analyses on lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) from 20 patients 
      diagnosed with BD classified as Li responders (n = 11) or non-responders (n = 9). 
      RESULTS: We found 335 mRNAs and 77 microRNAs (miRNAs) significantly modulated in 
      BD responders versus non-responders. Interestingly, pathway and network analyses 
      on these differentially expressed molecules suggested a modulatory effect of Li 
      on several immune-related functions. Indeed, among the functional molecular 
      nodes, we found NF-κB and TNF. Moreover, networks related to these molecules 
      resulted overall inhibited in BD responder patients, suggesting anti-inflammatory 
      properties of Li. From the integrative analysis between transcriptomics and 
      miRNomics data carried out using miRComb R package on the same samples from 
      patients diagnosed with BD, we found 97 significantly and negatively correlated 
      mRNA-miRNA pairs, mainly involved in inflammatory/immune response. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Our results highlight that Li exerts modulatory effects on immune-related 
      functions and that epigenetic mechanisms, especially miRNAs, can influence the 
      modulation of different genes and pathways involved in Li response. Moreover, our 
      data suggest the potentiality to integrate data coming from different 
      high-throughput approaches as a tool to prioritize genes and pathways.

      gut microbiota members and their postbiotics on Caco-2 cells.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is a complex infection caused 
      by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that can 
      cause also gastrointestinal symptoms. There are various factors that determine 
      the host susceptibility and severity of infection, including the 
      renin-angiotensin system, the immune response, and the gut microbiota. In this 
      regard, we aimed to investigate the gene expression of ACE, AGTR1, ACE2, and 
      TMPRSS2, which mediate SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis by Akkermansia muciniphila, 
      Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, and Bacteroides 
      fragilis on Caco-2 cells. Also, the enrichment analysis considering the studied 
      genes was analyzed on raw data from the microarray analysis of COVID-19 patients. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Caco-2 cells were treated with live, heat-inactivated form 
      and cell free supernatants of A. muciniphila, F. prausnitzii, B. thetaiotaomicron 
      and B. fragilis for overnight. After RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis, the 
      expression of studied genes was assessed by RT-qPCR. DNA methylation of studied 
      genes was analyzed by Partek® Genomics Suite® software on the GSE174818 dataset. 
      We used GSE164805 and GSE166552 datasets from COVID-19 patients to perform 
      enrichment analysis by considering the mentioned genes via GEO2R, DAVID. Finally, 
      the related microRNAs to GO terms concerned on the studied genes were identified 
      by miRPath. RESULTS: The downregulation of ACE, AGTR1, and ACE2 genes by A. 
      muciniphila, F. prausnitzii, B. thetaiotaomicron, and B. fragilis in live, 
      heat-inactivated, and cell-free supernatants was reported for the first time. 
      These genes had hypomethylated DNA status in COVID-19 patients' raw data. The 
      highest fold enrichment in upregulated RAS pathways and immune responses belonged 
      to ACE, AGTR1, and ACE2 by considering the protein-protein interaction network. 
      The common miRNAs targeting the studied genes were reported as miR-124-3p and 
      miR-26b-5p. CONCLUSION: In combination with our experimental data and 
      bioinformatic analysis, we showed the potential of A. muciniphila, F. 
      prausnitzii, B. thetaiotaomicron, and B. fragilis and their postbiotics to reduce 
      ACE, ATR1, and ACE2 expression, which are essential genes that drive upregulated 
      biological processes in COVID-19 patients. Accordingly, due to the potential of 
      studied bacteria on the alteration of ACE, AGTR1, ACE2 genes expression, 
      understanding their correlation with demonstrated miRNAs expression could be 
      valuable. These findings suggest the importance of considering targeted gut 
      microbiota intervention when designing the possible therapeutic strategy for 
      controlling the COVID-19.

TI  - Upregulated miR-18a-5p in Colony Forming Unit-Hill's in Subclinical 
      Cardiovascular Disease and Metformin Therapy; MERIT Study.

AB  - Colony forming unit-Hill's (CFU-Hill's) colonies are hematopoietic-derived cells 
      that participate in neovasculogenesis and serve as a biomarker for vascular 
      health. In animals, overexpression of miR-18a-5p was shown to be pro-atherogenic. 
      We had shown that well-controlled type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is 
      characterized by an inflammatory state, endothelial dysfunction, and reduced 
      number of CFU-Hill's, a model of subclinical cardiovascular disease (CVD). MERIT 
      study explored the role of miR-18a-5p expression in CFU-Hill's colonies in T1DM, 
      and the cardioprotective effect of metformin in subclinical CVD. In T1DM, 
      miR-18a-5p was significantly upregulated whereas metformin reduced it to HC 
      levels. MiR-18a-5p was inversely correlated with CFU-Hill's colonies, CD34+, 
      CD34+CD133+ cells, and positively with IL-10, C-reactive protein, vascular 
      endothelial growth factor-D (VEGF-D), and thrombomodulin. The receiver operating 
      characteristic curve demonstrated, miR-18a-5p as a biomarker of T1DM, and 
      upregulated miR-18a-5p defining subclinical CVD at HbA1c of 44.5 mmol/mol 
      (pre-diabetes). Ingenuity pathway analysis documented miR-18a-5p inhibiting mRNA 
      expression of insulin-like growth factor-1, estrogen receptor-1, 
      hypoxia-inducible factor-1α cellular communication network factor-2, and protein 
      inhibitor of activated STAT 3, whilst metformin upregulated these mRNAs via 
      transforming growth factor beta-1 and VEGF. We confirmed the pro-atherogenic 
      effect of miR-18a-5p in subclinical CVD and identified several target genes for 
      future CVD therapies.

AB  - Purpose: We aimed to establish the transcriptome diagnostic signature of 
      postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMOP) to identify diagnostic biomarkers and score 
      patient risk to prevent and treat PMOP. Methods: Peripheral blood mononuclear 
      cell (PBMC) expression data from PMOP patients were retrieved from the Gene 
      Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were 
      screened using the "limma" package. The "WGCNA" package was used for a weighted 
      gene co-expression network analysis to identify the gene modules associated with 
      bone mineral density (BMD). Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator 
      (LASSO) regression was used to construct a diagnostic signature, and its 
      predictive ability was verified in the discovery cohort. The diagnostic values of 
      potential biomarkers were evaluated by receiver operating characteristic curve 
      (ROC) and coefficient analysis. Network pharmacology was used to predict the 
      candidate therapeutic molecules. PBMCs from 14 postmenopausal women with normal 
      BMD and 14 with low BMD were collected, and RNA was extracted for RT-qPCR 
      validation. Results: We screened 2420 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from 
      the pilot cohort, and WGCNA showed that the blue module was most closely related 
      to BMD. Based on the genes in the blue module, we constructed a diagnostic 
      signature with 15 genes, and its ability to predict the risk of osteoporosis was 
      verified in the discovery cohort. RT-qPCR verified the expression of potential 
      biomarkers and showed a strong correlation with BMD. The functional annotation 
      results of the DEGs showed that the diagnostic signature might affect the 
      occurrence and development of PMOP through multiple biological pathways. In 
      addition, 5 candidate molecules related to diagnostic signatures were screened 
      out. Conclusion: Our diagnostic signature can effectively predict the risk of 
      PMOP, with potential application for clinical decisions and drug candidate 
      selection.

AB  - Osteoporosis (OP) is a common bone disease of old age resulting from the 
      imbalance between bone resorption and bone formation. CircRNAs are a class of 
      endogenous non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) involved in gene regulation and may play 
      important roles in the development of OP. Here, we aimed to discover the 
      OP‑related circRNA-miRNA-mRNA (ceRNA) network and the potential mechanisms. Six 
      microarray datasets were obtained from the GEO database and the OP‑related 
      differentially expressed genes (DEGs), circRNAs (DECs), and miRNAs (DEMs) were 
      screened out from these datasets. Then, combined with the prediction of the 
      relationships between DEGs, DEMs, and DECs, a ceRNA network containing 7 target 
      circRNAs, 5 target miRNAs, and 38 target genes was constructed. Then the RNA-seq 
      verification by using total RNAs isolated from the femurs of normal and 
      ovariectomized Wistar rats indicated that MFAP5, CAMK2A, and RGS4 in the ceRNA 
      network were closely associated with osteoporosis. Function enrichment analysis 
      indicated that the target circRNAs, miRNAs, and genes were involved in the 
      process of MAPK cascade, hormone stimulus, cadherin binding, rRNA 
      methyltransferase, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, and Vitamin digestion and 
      absorption, etc. Then a circRNA-miRNA-hub gene subnetwork was constructed and the 
      qRT-PCR analysis of human bone tissues from the femoral head was used to confirm 
      that the transcription of hsa_circR_0028877, hsa_circR_0082916, DIRAS2, CAMK2A, 
      and MAPK4 showed a significant correlation with osteogenic genes. Besides, the 
      two axes of hsa_circR_0028877/hsa-miR-1273f/CAMK2A and 
      hsa_circR_0028877/hsa-miR-1273f/DIRAS2 conformed to be closely associated with 
      OP. Additionally, by constructing a drug-target gene network, RKI-1447, FRAX486, 
      Hyaluronic, and Fostamatinib were identified as therapeutic options for OP. Our 
      study revealed the potential links between circRNAs, miRNAs, and mRNAs in OP, 
      suggesting that the ceRNA mechanism might contribute to the occurrence of OP.

TI  - Epigenetic Profiling in the Saliva of Obese Pregnant Women.
LID - 10.3390/nu14102122 [doi]
LID - 2122
AB  - Maternal obesity is associated with inflammation and oxidative stress, strongly 
      impacting the intrauterine environment with detrimental consequences for both 
      mother and offspring. The saliva is a non-invasive biofluid reflecting both local 
      and systemic health status. This observational study aimed to profile the 
      epigenetic signature in the saliva of Obese (OB) and Normal-Weight (NW) pregnant 
      women. Sixteen NW and sixteen OB Caucasian women with singleton spontaneous 
      pregnancies were enrolled. microRNAs were quantified by the OpenArray Platform. 
      The promoter region methylation of Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 (SOCS3) and 
      Transforming Growth Factor Beta 1 (TGF-Beta1) was assessed by pyrosequencing. 
      There were 754 microRNAs evaluated: 20 microRNAs resulted in being differentially 
      expressed between OB and NW. microRNA pathway enrichment analysis showed a 
      significant association with the TGF-Beta signaling pathway (miTALOS) and with 
      fatty acids biosynthesis/metabolism, lysine degradation, and ECM-receptor 
      interaction pathways (DIANA-miRPath). Both SOCS3 and TGF-Beta1 were significantly 
      down-methylated in OB vs. NW. These results help to clarify impaired mechanisms 
      involved in obesity and pave the way for the understanding of specific damaged 
      pathways. The characterization of the epigenetic profile in saliva of pregnant 
      women can represent a promising tool for the identification of obesity-related 
      altered mechanisms and of possible biomarkers for early diagnosis and treatment 
      of pregnancy-adverse conditions.

TI  - BRAF(V600E) Induction in Thyrocytes Triggers Important Changes in the miRNAs 
      Content and the Populations of Extracellular Vesicles Released in Thyroid Tumor 
      Microenvironment.
LID - 10.3390/biomedicines10040755 [doi]

AB  - Papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) is the most common endocrine malignancy for which 
      diagnosis and recurrences still challenge clinicians. New perspectives to 
      overcome these issues could come from the study of extracellular vesicle (EV) 
      populations and content. Here, we aimed to elucidate the heterogeneity of EVs 
      circulating in the tumor and the changes in their microRNA content during cancer 
      progression. Using a mouse model expressing BRAF(V600E), we isolated and 
      characterized EVs from thyroid tissue by ultracentrifugations and elucidated 
      their microRNA content by small RNA sequencing. The cellular origin of EVs was 
      investigated by ExoView and that of deregulated EV-microRNA by qPCR on 
      FACS-sorted cell populations. We found that PTC released more EVs bearing 
      epithelial and immune markers, as compared to the healthy thyroid, so that 
      changes in EV-microRNAs abundance were mainly due to their deregulated expression 
      in thyrocytes. Altogether, our work provides a full description of in 
      vivo-derived EVs produced by, and within, normal and cancerous thyroid. We 
      elucidated the global EV-microRNAs signature, the dynamic loading of microRNAs in 
      EVs upon BRAF(V600E) induction, and their cellular origin. Finally, we propose 
      that thyroid tumor-derived EV-microRNAs could support the establishment of a 
      permissive immune microenvironment.

TI  - TNF-α Induced Myotube Atrophy in C2C12 Cell Line Uncovers Putative 
      Inflammatory-Related lncRNAs Mediating Muscle Wasting.
LID - 10.3390/ijms23073878 [doi]
LID - 3878
AB  - BACKGROUND: Muscle atrophy is a complex catabolic condition developing under 
      different inflammatory-related systemic diseases resulting in wasting of muscle 
      tissue. While the knowledge of the molecular background of muscle atrophy has 
      developed in recent years, how the atrophic conditions affect the long non-coding 
      RNA (lncRNAs) machinery and the exact participation of the latter in the 
      mediation of muscle loss are still unknown. The purpose of the study was to 
      assess how inflammatory condition developing under the tumor necrosis factor 
      alpha (TNF-α) treatment affects the lncRNAs' expression in a mouse skeletal 
      muscle cell line. MATERIALS AND METHOD: A C2C12 mouse myoblast cell line was 
      treated with TNF-α to develop atrophy, and inflammatory-related lncRNAs mediating 
      muscle loss were identified. Bioinformatics was used to validate and analyze the 
      discovered lncRNAs. The differences in their expression under different TNF-α 
      concentrations and treatment times were investigated. RESULTS: Five lncRNAs were 
      identified in a discovery set as atrophy related and then validated. Three 
      lncRNAs, Gm4117, Ccdc41os1, and 5830418P13Rik, were selected as being significant 
      for inflammatory-related myotube atrophy. Dynamics changes in the expression of 
      lncRNAs depended on both TNF-α concentration and treatment time. Bioinformatics 
      analysis revealed the mRNA and miRNA target for selected lncRNAs and their 
      putative involvement in the molecular processes related to muscle atrophy. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The inflammatory condition developing in the myotube under the TNF-α 
      treatment affects the alteration of lncRNAs' expression pattern. Experimental and 
      bioinformatics testing suggested the prospective role of lncRNAs in the mediation 
      of muscle loss under an inflammatory state.

TI  - Mechanisms of Action of Extracorporeal Photopheresis in the Control of 
      Bronchiolitis Obliterans Syndrome (BOS): Involvement of Circulating miRNAs.
LID - 10.3390/cells11071117 [doi]
LID - 1117
AB  - Clinical evidence suggests an improvement or stabilization of lung function in a 
      fraction of patients with bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) treated by 
      extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP); however, few studies have explored the 
      epigenetic and molecular regulation of this therapy. The aim of present study was 
      to evaluate whether a specific set of miRNAs were significantly regulated by ECP. 
      Total RNA was isolated from serum of patients with established BOS grade 1-2 
      prior to the start and after 6 months of ECP treatment. We observed a significant 
      downregulation of circulating hsa-miR-155-5p, hsa-miR-146a-5p and hsa-miR-31-5p 
      in BOS patients at the start of ECP when compared to healthy subjects. In 
      responders, increased miR-155-5p and decreased miR-23b-3p expression levels at 6 
      months were found. SMAD4 mRNA was found to be a common target of these two miRNAs 
      in prediction pathways analysis, and a significant downregulation was found at 6 
      months in PBMCs of a subgroup of ECP-treated patients. According to previous 
      evidence, the upregulation of miR-155 might be correlated with a pro-tolerogenic 
      modulation of the immune system. Our analysis also suggests that SMAD4 might be a 
      possible target for miR-155-5p. Further longitudinal studies are needed to 
      address the possible role of miR-155 and its downstream targets.

AB  - Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) is one of the most prevalent mental disorders 
      worldwide. Considering the widespread occurrence of AUD, a reliable, cheap, 
      non-invasive biomarker of alcohol consumption is desired by healthcare providers, 
      clinicians, researchers, public health and criminal justice officials. microRNAs 
      could serve as such biomarkers. They are easily detectable in saliva, which can 
      be sampled from individuals in a non-invasive manner. Moreover, microRNAs 
      expression is dynamically regulated by environmental factors, including alcohol. 
      Since excessive alcohol consumption is a hallmark of alcohol abuse, we have 
      profiled microRNA expression in the saliva of chronic, heavy alcohol abusers 
      using microRNA microarrays. We observed significant changes in salivary microRNA 
      expression caused by excessive alcohol consumption. These changes fell into three 
      categories: downregulated microRNAs, upregulated microRNAs, and microRNAs 
      upregulated de novo. Analysis of these combinatorial changes in microRNA 
      expression suggests dysregulation of specific biological pathways leading to 
      impairment of the immune system and development of several types of epithelial 
      cancer. Moreover, some of the altered microRNAs are also modulators of 
      inflammation, suggesting their contribution to pro-inflammatory mechanisms of 
      alcohol actions. Establishment of the cellular source of microRNAs in saliva 
      corroborated these results. We determined that most of the microRNAs in saliva 
      come from two types of cells: leukocytes involved in immune responses and 
      inflammation, and buccal cells, involved in development of epithelial, oral 
      cancers. In summary, we propose that microRNA profiling in saliva can be a 
      useful, non-invasive biomarker allowing the monitoring of alcohol abuse, as well 
      as alcohol-related inflammation and early detection of cancer.

AB  - The vascular endothelium is a hot spot in the response to radiation therapy for 
      both tumors and normal tissues. To improve patient outcomes, interpretable 
      systemic hypotheses are needed to help radiobiologists and radiation oncologists 
      propose endothelial targets that could protect normal tissues from the adverse 
      effects of radiation therapy and/or enhance its antitumor potential. To this end, 
      we captured the kinetics of multi-omics layers-i.e. miRNome, targeted 
      transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome-in irradiated primary human endothelial 
      cells cultured in vitro. We then designed a strategy of deep learning as in 
      convolutional graph networks that facilitates unsupervised high-level feature 
      extraction of important omics data to learn how ionizing radiation-induced 
      endothelial dysfunction may evolve over time. Last, we present experimental data 
      showing that some of the features identified using our approach are involved in 
      the alteration of angiogenesis by ionizing radiation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE AND DESIGN: Phagocytosis and clearance of apoptotic cells are essential 
      for inflammation resolution, efficient wound healing, and tissue homeostasis. 
      MicroRNAs are critical modulators of macrophage polarization and function. The 
      current study aimed to investigate the role of miR-181c-5p in macrophage 
      phagocytosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: miR-181c-5p was identified as a potential 
      candidate in microRNA screening of RAW264.7 macrophages fed with apoptotic cells. 
      To investigate the role of miR-181c-5p in phagocytosis, the expression of 
      miR-181c-5p was assessed in phagocyting bone marrow-derived macrophages. 
      Phagocytosis efficiency was measured by fluorescence microscopy. Gain- and 
      loss-of-function studies were performed using miR-181c-5p-specific mimic and 
      inhibitor. The expression of the phagocytosis-associated genes and proteins of 
      interest was evaluated by RT(2) profiler PCR array and western blotting, 
      respectively. RESULTS: miR-181c-5p expression was significantly upregulated in 
      the phagocyting macrophages. Furthermore, mimic-induced overexpression of 
      miR-181c-5p resulted in the increased phagocytic ability of macrophages. 
      Moreover, overexpression of miR-181c-5p resulted in upregulation of WAVE-2 in 
      phagocyting macrophages, suggesting that miR-181c-5p may regulate cytoskeletal 
      arrangement during macrophage phagocytosis. CONCLUSION: Altogether, our data 
      provide a novel function of miR-181c-5p in macrophage biology and suggest that 
      targeting macrophage miR-181c-5p in injured tissues might improve clearance of 
      dead cells and lead to efficient inflammation resolution.

TI  - Development of a novel and synthetic HematoMiR technology that broadly modulates 
      quiescence of stem cells and enhances HSC expansion.
PG  - 68

AB  - Hematopoietic stem cell (HSCs) transplantation is the primary therapeutic 
      modality used to treat hematopoietic disorders. It centers on the capability of a 
      small quantity of HSCs to repopulate whole blood lineages. Along with limited 
      availability of suitable donors, the need for sufficient number of donor HSCs is 
      still challenging in clinical relevance. This has been addressed by ex vivo HSC 
      expansion albeit with partial success, and thus development of an alternative 
      strategy that could improve HSC expansion is required. To that end, we aimed to 
      build HematoMiR, an oligo-based technology that broadly targets HSC quiescence 
      factors. Here, we show that HematoMiRs and their combinations targeting over 50 
      factors involved in HSC quiescence could induce robust ex vivo murine and human 
      HSC expansion. In particular, HematoMiR-5 treatment enhanced cell cycle through 
      down-regulation of negative cell cycle regulators in HSCs. HematoMiR-5 treated 
      HSPCs had reduced DNA damage during the course of ex vivo expansion. Moreover, 
      HematoMiR-5 treatment led to sustained HSC self-renewal ability and a low 
      apoptosis rate. In addition, HematoMiR-5 expanded HSCs demonstrated successful 
      engraftment and repopulation capacity in the recipient animals. Furthermore, 
      combinatorial treatments of HematoMiR-2 and 5 allowed vigorous ex vivo HSC 
      expansion. These findings demonstrate that novel and synthetic HematoMiR 
      technology is feasible for HSC ex vivo expansion through the sequence-dependent 
      modulation of numerous HSC quiescence modulators.

TI  - Co-Expression Network Analysis of Micro-RNAs and Proteins in the Alzheimer's

AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding nucleic acids that can regulate 
      post-transcriptional gene expression by binding to complementary sequences of 
      target mRNA. Evidence showed that dysregulated miRNA expression may be associated 
      with neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we 
      combined the results of two independent systematic reviews aiming to unveil the 
      co-expression network of miRNAs and proteins in brain tissues of AD patients. 
      Twenty-eight studies including a total of 113 differentially expressed miRNAs (53 
      of them validated by qRT-PCR), and 26 studies including a total of 196 proteins 
      differentially expressed in AD brains compared to healthy age matched controls 
      were selected. Pathways analyses were performed on the results of the two reviews 
      and 39 common pathways were identified. A further bioinformatic analysis was 
      performed to match miRNA and protein targets with an inverse relation. This 
      revealed 249 inverse relationships in 28 common pathways, representing new 
      potential targets for therapeutic intervention. A meta-analysis, whenever 
      possible, revealed miR-132-3p and miR-16 as consistently downregulated in 
      late-stage AD across the literature. While no inverse relationships between 
      miR-132-3p and proteins were found, miR-16's inverse relationship with CLOCK 
      proteins in the circadian rhythm pathway is discussed and therapeutic targets are 
      proposed. The most significant miRNA dysregulated pathway highlighted in this 
      review was the hippo signaling pathway with p = 1.66 × 10(-9). Our study has 
      revealed new mechanisms for AD pathogenesis and this is discussed along with 
      opportunities to develop novel miRNA-based drugs to target these pathways.

AB  - Multiple myeloma (MM) is the second most common hematological malignancy, arising 
      from terminally differentiated B cells, namely plasma cells. miRNAs are small 
      non-coding RNAs that participate in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene 
      expression. In this study, we investigated the role of nine miRNAs in MM. CD138+ 
      plasma cells were selected from bone marrow aspirates from MM and smoldering MM 
      (sMM) patients. Total RNA was extracted and in vitro polyadenylated. Next, 
      first-strand cDNA synthesis was performed using an oligo-dT-adapter primer. For 
      the relative quantification of the investigated miRNAs, an in-house real-time 
      quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay was developed. A functional in silico analysis of 
      the miRNAs was also performed. miR-16-5p and miR-155-5p expression was 
      significantly lower in the CD138+ plasma cells of MM patients than in those of 
      sMM patients. Furthermore, lower levels of miR-15a-5p, miR-16-5p, and miR-222-3p 
      were observed in the CD138+ plasma cells of MM patients with osteolytic bone 
      lesions, compared to those without. miR-125b-5p was also overexpressed in the 
      CD138+ plasma cells of MM patients with bone disease that presented with 
      skeletal-related events (SREs). Furthermore, lower levels of miR-223-3p were 
      associated with significantly worse overall survival in MM patients. In 
      conclusion, we propose a miRNA signature with putative clinical utility in MM.

TI  - Wnt-Signaling Regulated by Glucocorticoid-Induced miRNAs.
LID - 10.3390/ijms222111778 [doi]
LID - 11778
AB  - Glucocorticoids (GCs) are pleiotropic hormones which regulate innumerable 
      physiological processes. Their comprehensive effects are due to the diversity of 
      signaling mechanism networks. MiRNAs, small, non-coding RNAs contribute to the 
      fine tuning of signaling pathways and reciprocal regulation between GCs and 
      miRNAs has been suggested. Our aim was to investigate the expressional change and 
      potential function of GC mediated miRNAs. The miRNA expression profile was 
      measured in three models: human adrenocortical adenoma vs. normal tissue, 
      steroid-producing H295R cells and in hormonally inactive HeLa cells before and 
      after dexamethasone treatment. The gene expression profile in 82 control and 57 
      GC-affected samples was evaluated in GC producing and six different GC target 
      tissue types. Tissue-specific target prediction (TSTP) was applied to identify 
      the most relevant miRNA-mRNA interactions. Glucocorticoid treatment resulted in 
      cell type-dependent miRNA expression changes. However, 19.5% of the influenced 
      signaling pathways were common in all three experiments, of which the 
      Wnt-signaling pathway seemed to be the most affected. Transcriptome data and TSTP 
      showed similar results, as the Wnt pathway was significantly altered in both the 
      GC-producing adrenal gland and all investigated GC target tissue types. In 
      different cell types, different miRNAs led to the regulation of similar pathways. 
      Wnt signaling may be one of the most important signaling pathways affected by 
      hypercortisolism. It is, at least in part, regulated by miRNAs that mediate the 
      glucocorticoid effect. Our findings on GC producing and GC target tissues suggest 
      that the alteration of Wnt signaling (together with other pathways) may be 
      responsible for the leading symptoms observed in Cushing's syndrome.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Neuroinflammation occupies a pivotal position in the pathogenesis of 
      most nervous system diseases, including depression. However, the underlying 
      molecular mechanisms of neuroinflammation associated with neuronal injury in 
      depression remain largely uncharacterized. Therefore, identifying potential 
      molecular mechanisms and therapeutic targets would serve to better understand the 
      progression of this condition. METHODS: Chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) was 
      used to induce depression-like behaviors in rats. RNA-sequencing was used to 
      detect the differentially expressed microRNAs. Stereotactic injection of AAV 
      virus to overexpress or knockdown the miR-204-5p. The oxidative markers and 
      inflammatory related proteins were verified by immunoblotting or 
      immunofluorescence assay. The oxidative stress enzyme and products were verified 
      using enzyme-linked assay kit. Electron microscopy analysis was used to observe 
      the synapse and ultrastructural pathology. Finally, electrophysiological 
      recording was used to analyze the synaptic transmission. RESULTS: Here, we found 
      that the expression of miR-204-5p within the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) 
      region of rats was significantly down-regulated after chronic unpredicted stress 
      (CUS), accompanied with the oxidative stress-induced neuronal damage within DG 
      region of these rats. In contrast, overexpression of miR-204-5p within the DG 
      region of CUS rats alleviated oxidative stress and neuroinflammation by directly 
      targeting the regulator of G protein signaling 12 (RGS12), effects which were 
      accompanied with amelioration of depressive-like behaviors in these CUS rats. In 
      addition, down-regulation of miR-204-5p induced neuronal deterioration in DG 
      regions and depressive-like behaviors in rats. CONCLUSION: Taken together, these 
      results suggest that miR-204-5p plays a key role in regulating oxidative stress 
      damage in CUS-induced pathological processes of depression. Such findings provide 
      evidence of the involvement of miR-204-5p in mechanisms underlying oxidative 
      stress associated with depressive phenotype.

AB  - Age-related disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and age-related macular 
      degeneration (AMD) share common features such as amyloid-β (Aβ) protein 
      accumulation. Retinal deposition of Aβ aggregates in AMD patients has suggested a 
      potential link between AMD and AD. In the present study, we analyzed the 
      expression pattern of a focused set of miRNAs, previously found to be involved in 
      both AD and AMD, in the retina of a triple transgenic mouse model of AD (3xTg-AD) 
      at different time-points. Several miRNAs were differentially expressed in the 
      retina of 3xTg-AD mice, compared to the retina of age-matched wild-type (WT) 
      mice. In particular, bioinformatic analysis revealed that miR-155 had a central 
      role in miRNA-gene network stability, regulating several pathways, including 
      apoptotic and inflammatory signaling pathways modulated by TNF-related 
      apoptosis-inducing ligand (TNFSF10). We showed that chronic treatment of 3xTg-AD 
      mice with an anti-TNFSF10 monoclonal antibody was able to inhibit the retinal 
      expression of miR-155, which inversely correlated with the expression of its 
      molecular target SOCS-1. Moreover, the fine-tuned mechanism related to TNFSF10 
      immunoneutralization was tightly linked to modulation of TNFSF10 itself and its 
      death receptor TNFRSF10B, along with cytokine production by microglia, reactive 
      gliosis, and specific AD-related neuropathological hallmarks (i.e., Aβ deposition 
      and Tau phosphorylation) in the retina of 3xTg-AD mice. In conclusion, 
      immunoneutralization of TNFSF10 significantly preserved the retinal tissue in 
      3xTg-AD mice, suggesting its potential therapeutic application in retinal 
      degenerative disorders.

AB  - In this era of big data, sets of methodologies and strategies are designed to 
      extract knowledge from huge volumes of data. However, the cost of where and how 
      to get this information accurately and quickly is extremely important, given the 
      diversity of genomes and the different ways of representing that information. 
      Among the huge set of information and relationships that the genome carries, 
      there are sequences called miRNAs (microRNAs). These sequences were described in 
      the 1990s and are mainly involved in mechanisms of regulation and gene 
      expression. Having this in mind, this chapter focuses on exploring the available 
      literature and providing useful and practical guidance on the miRNA database and 
      tools topic. For that, we organized and present this text in two ways: (a) the 
      update reviews and articles, which best summarize and discuss the theme; and (b) 
      our update investigation on miRNA literature and portals about databases and 
      tools. Finally, we present the main challenge and a possible solution to improve 
      resources and tools.

TI  - Epigenetic reprogramming enhances the therapeutic efficacy of osteoblast-derived 
      extracellular vesicles to promote human bone marrow stem cell osteogenic 
      differentiation.

AB  - Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are emerging in tissue engineering as promising 
      acellular tools, circumventing many of the limitations associated with cell-based 
      therapies. Epigenetic regulation through histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition 
      has been shown to increase differentiation capacity. Therefore, this study aimed 
      to investigate the potential of augmenting osteoblast epigenetic functionality 
      using the HDAC inhibitor Trichostatin A (TSA) to enhance the therapeutic efficacy 
      of osteoblast-derived EVs for bone regeneration. TSA was found to substantially 
      alter osteoblast epigenetic function through reduced HDAC activity and increased 
      histone acetylation. Treatment with TSA also significantly enhanced osteoblast 
      alkaline phosphatase activity (1.35-fold), collagen production (2.8-fold) and 
      calcium deposition (1.55-fold) during osteogenic culture (P ≤ 0.001). EVs derived 
      from TSA-treated osteoblasts (TSA-EVs) exhibited reduced particle size 
      (1-05-fold) (P > 0.05), concentration (1.4-fold) (P > 0.05) and protein content 
      (1.16-fold) (P ≤ 0.001) when compared to untreated EVs. TSA-EVs significantly 
      enhanced the proliferation (1.13-fold) and migration (1.3-fold) of human bone 
      marrow stem cells (hBMSCs) when compared to untreated EVs (P ≤ 0.05). Moreover, 
      TSA-EVs upregulated hBMSCs osteoblast-related gene and protein expression (ALP, 
      Col1a, BSP1 and OCN) when compared to cells cultured with untreated EVs. 
      Importantly, TSA-EVs elicited a time-dose dependent increase in hBMSCs 
      extracellular matrix mineralisation. MicroRNA profiling revealed a set of 
      differentially expressed microRNAs from TSA-EVs, which were osteogenic-related. 
      Target prediction demonstrated these microRNAs were involved in regulating 
      pathways such as 'endocytosis' and 'Wnt signalling pathway'. Moreover, proteomics 
      analysis identified the enrichment of proteins involved in transcriptional 
      regulation within TSA-EVs. Taken together, our findings suggest that altering 
      osteoblasts' epigenome accelerates their mineralisation and promotes the 
      osteoinductive potency of secreted EVs partly due to the delivery of 
      pro-osteogenic microRNAs and transcriptional regulating proteins. As such, for 
      the first time we demonstrate the potential to harness epigenetic regulation as a 
      novel engineering approach to enhance EVs therapeutic efficacy for bone repair.

AB  - Depression is a neuropsychiatric disease associated with neuronal anomalies 
      within specific brain regions. In the present study, we screened microRNA (miRNA) 
      expression profiles in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus and found that 
      miR-26a-3p was markedly downregulated in a rat model of depression, whereas 
      upregulation of miR-26a-3p within DG regions rescued the neuronal deterioration 
      and depression-like phenotypes resulting from stress exposure, effects that 
      appear to be mediated by the PTEN pathway. The knockdown of miR-26a-3p in DG 
      regions of normal control rats induced depression-like behaviors, effects that 
      were accompanied by activation of the PTEN/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and 
      neuronal deterioration via suppression of autophagy, impairments in synaptic 
      plasticity, and promotion of neuronal apoptosis. In conclusion, these results 
      suggest that miR-26a-3p deficits within the hippocampal DG mediated the neuronal 
      anomalies contributing to the display of depression-like behaviors. This miRNA 
      may serve as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of depression.

TI  - Simulated Microgravity Effects on Human Adenocarcinoma Alveolar Epithelial Cells: 
      Characterization of Morphological, Functional, and Epigenetic Parameters.
LID - 10.3390/ijms22136951 [doi]
LID - 6951
AB  - BACKGROUND: In space, the reduction or loss of the gravity vector greatly affects 
      the interaction between cells. Since the beginning of the space age, microgravity 
      has been identified as an informative tool in biomedicine, including cancer 
      research. The A549 cell line is a hypotriploid human alveolar basal epithelial 
      cell line widely used as a model for lung adenocarcinoma. Microgravity has been 
      reported to interfere with mitochondrial activity, energy metabolism, cell 
      vitality and proliferation, chemosensitivity, invasion and morphology of cells 
      and organelles in various biological systems. Concerning lung cancer, several 
      studies have reported the ability of microgravity to modulate the carcinogenic 
      and metastatic process. To investigate these processes, A549 cells were exposed 
      to simulated microgravity (µG) for different time points. METHODS: We performed 
      cell cycle and proliferation assays, ultrastructural analysis of mitochondria 
      architecture, as well as a global analysis of miRNA modulated under µG 
      conditions. RESULTS: The exposure of A549 cells to microgravity is accompanied by 
      the generation of polynucleated cells, cell cycle imbalance, growth inhibition, 
      and gross morphological abnormalities, the most evident are highly damaged 
      mitochondria. Global miRNA analysis defined a pool of miRNAs associated with µG 
      solicitation mainly involved in cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and stress 
      response. To our knowledge, this is the first global miRNA analysis of A549 
      exposed to microgravity reported. Despite these results, it is not possible to 
      draw any conclusion concerning the ability of µG to interfere with the 
      cancerogenic or the metastatic processes in A549 cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our results 
      provide evidence that mitochondria are strongly sensitive to µG. We suggest that 
      mitochondria damage might in turn trigger miRNA modulation related to cell cycle 
      imbalance.

TI  - SNPs at 3'UTR of APOL1 and miR-6741-3p target sites associated with kidney 
      diseases more susceptible to SARS-COV-2 infection: in silco and in vitro studies.
PG  - 389-400
LID - 10.1007/s00335-021-09880-6 [doi]
AB  - Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a common manifestation of COVID-19 and several cases 
      have been reported in the setting of the high-risk APOL1 genotype (common genetic 
      variants). This increases the likelihood that African American people with the 
      high-risk genotype APOL1 are at increased risk for kidney disease in the COVID-19 
      environment. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are found in various 
      microRNAs (miRNAs) and target genes change the miRNA activity that leads to 
      different diseases. Evidence has shown that SNPs increase/decrease the 
      effectiveness of the interaction between miRNAs and disease-related target genes. 
      The aim of this study is not only to identify miRSNPs on the APOL1 gene and SNPs 
      in miRNA genes targeting 3'UTR but also to evaluate the effect of these gene 
      variations in kidney patients and their association with SARS-COV-2 infection. In 
      3'UTR of the APOL1 gene, we detected 96 miRNA binding sites and 35 different SNPs 
      with 10 different online software in the binding sites of the miRNA (in silico). 
      Also we studied gene expression of patients and control samples by using qRT-PCR 
      (in vitro). In silico study, the binding site of miR-6741-3p on APOL1 has two 
      SNPs (rs1288875001, G > C; rs1452517383, A > C) on APOL1 3'UTR, and its genomic 
      sequence is the same nucleotide as rs1288875001. Similarly, two other SNPs 
      (rs1142591, T > A; rs376326225, G > A) were identified in the binding sites of 
      miR-6741-3p at the first position. Here, the miRSNP (rs1288875001) in APOL1 3'UTR 
      and SNP (rs376326225) in the miR-6741-3p genomic sequence are cross-matched in 
      the same binding region. In vitro study, the relative expression levels were 
      calculated by the 2(-ΔΔCt) method & Mann-Whitney U test. The expression of APOL1 
      gene was different in chronic kidney patients along with COVID-19. By these 
      results, APOL1 expression was found lower in patients than healthy (p < 0.05) in 
      kidney patients along with COVID-19. In addition, miR-6741-3p targets many 
      APOL1-related genes (TLR7, SLC6A19, IL-6,10,18, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5, 
      SWT1, NFYB, BRF1, HES2, NFYB, MED12L, MAFG, GTF2H5, TRAF3, angiotensin II 
      receptor-associated protein, PRSS23) by evaluating online software in the binding 
      sites of the miR-6741-3p. miR-6741-3p has not previously shown any association 
      with kidney diseases and SARS-COV-2 infection. It assures that APOL1 can have a 
      significant consequence in kidney-associated diseases by different pathways. 
      Henceforth, this study represents and demonstrates an effective association 
      between miR-6741-3p and kidney diseases, i.e., collapsing glomerulopathy, chronic 
      kidney disease (CKD), acute kidney injury (AKI), and tubulointerstitial lesions 
      susceptibility to SARS-COV-2 infection via in silico and in vitro exploration and 
      recommended to have better insight.

AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs. They can regulate the expression of 
      their target genes, and thus, their dysregulation significantly contributes to 
      the development of cancer. Growing evidence suggests that miRNAs could be used as 
      cancer biomarkers. As an oncogenic miRNA, the roles of miR-21 as a diagnostic and 
      prognostic biomarker, and its therapeutic applications have been extensively 
      studied. In this review, the roles of miR-21 are first demonstrated via its 
      different molecular networks. Then, a comprehensive review on the potential 
      targets and the current applications as a diagnostic and prognostic cancer 
      biomarker and the therapeutic roles of miR-21 in six different cancers in the 
      digestive system is provided. Lastly, a brief discussion on the challenges for 
      the use of miR-21 as a therapeutic tool for these cancers is added.

AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNA) are small non-coding RNA molecules involved in 
      post-transcriptional gene regulation. Deregulation of miRNA expression occurs in 
      cancer, and miRNA expression profiles have been associated with diagnosis and 
      prognosis in many cancers. Osteosarcoma (OS), an aggressive primary tumor of 
      bone, affects ~10,000 dogs each year. Though survival has improved with the 
      addition of chemotherapy, up to 80% of canine patients will succumb to metastatic 
      disease. Reliable prognostic markers are lacking for this disease. miRNAs are 
      attractive targets of biomarker discovery efforts due to their increased 
      stability in easily obtained body fluids as well as within fixed tissue. Previous 
      studies in our laboratory demonstrated that dysregulation of genes in aggressive 
      canine OS tumors that participate in miRNA regulatory networks is reportedly 
      disrupted in OS or other cancers. We utilized RT-qPCR in a 384-well-plate system 
      to measure the relative expression of 190 miRNAs in 14 canine tumors from two 
      cohorts of dogs with good or poor outcome (disease-free interval >300 or <100 
      days, respectively). Differential expression analysis in this subset guided the 
      selection of candidate miRNAs in tumors and serum samples from larger groups of 
      dogs. We ultimately identified a tumor-based three-miR Cox proportional hazards 
      regression model and a serum-based two-miR model, each being able to distinguish 
      patients with good and poor prognosis via Kaplan-Meier analysis with log rank 
      test. Additionally, we integrated miRNA and gene expression data to identify 
      potentially important miRNA-mRNA interactions that are disrupted in canine OS. 
      Integrated analyses of miRNAs in the three-miR predictive model and disrupted 
      genes from previous expression studies suggest the contribution of the primary 
      tumor microenvironment to the metastatic phenotype of aggressive tumors.

TI  - Circulating miRNAs as Biomarkers for Mitochondrial Neuro-Gastrointestinal 
      Encephalomyopathy.
LID - 10.3390/ijms22073681 [doi]
LID - 3681
AB  - Mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy (MNGIE) is an ultra-rare 
      disease for which there are currently no validated outcome measures for assessing 
      therapeutic intervention efficacy. The aim of this study was to identify a plasma 
      and/or serum microRNA (miRNA) biomarker panel for MNGIE. Sixty-five patients and 
      65 age and sex matched healthy controls were recruited and assigned to one of 
      four study phases: (i) discovery for sample size determination; (ii) candidate 
      screening; (iii) candidate validation; and (iv) verifying the performance of the 
      validated miRNA panel in four patients treated with erythrocyte-encapsulated 
      thymidine phosphorylase (EE-TP), an enzyme replacement under development for 
      MNGIE. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was used to profile miRNAs in serum and/or plasma 
      samples collected for the discovery, validation and performance phases, and next 
      generation sequencing (NGS) analysis was applied to serum samples assigned to the 
      candidate screening phase. Forty-one differentially expressed candidate miRNAs 
      were identified in the sera of patients (p < 0.05, log(2) fold change > 1). The 
      validation cohort revealed that of those, 27 miRNAs were upregulated in plasma 
      and three miRNAs were upregulated in sera (p < 0.05). Through binary logistic 
      regression analyses, five plasma miRNAs (miR-192-5p, miR-193a-5p, miR-194-5p, 
      miR-215-5p and miR-34a-5p) and three serum miRNAs (miR-192-5p, miR-194-5p and 
      miR-34a-5p) were shown to robustly distinguish MNGIE from healthy controls. 
      Reduced longitudinal miRNA expression of miR-34a-5p was observed in all four 
      patients treated with EE-TP and coincided with biochemical and clinical 
      improvements. We recommend the inclusion of the plasma exploratory miRNA 
      biomarker panel in future clinical trials of investigational therapies for MNGIE; 
      it may have prognostic value for assessing clinical status.

TI  - Nanocell-mediated delivery of miR-34a counteracts temozolomide resistance in 
      glioblastoma.
PG  - 28
LID - 10.1186/s10020-021-00293-4 [doi]
LID - 28
AB  - BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma is the most common primary brain tumor and remains 
      uniformly fatal, highlighting the dire need for developing effective 
      therapeutics. Significant intra- and inter-tumor heterogeneity and inadequate 
      delivery of therapeutics across blood-brain barrier continue to be significant 
      impediments towards developing therapies which can significantly enhance 
      survival. We hypothesize that microRNAs have the potential to serve as effective 
      therapeutics for glioblastoma as they modulate the activity of multiple signaling 
      pathways, and hence can counteract heterogeneity if successfully delivered. 
      METHODS: Using a computational approach, we identified microRNA-34a as a microRNA 
      that maximally reduces the activation status of the three core signaling networks 
      (the receptor tyrosine kinase, p53 and Rb networks) that have been found to be 
      deregulated in most glioblastoma tumors. Glioblastoma cultures were transfected 
      with microRNA-34a or control microRNA to assess biological function and 
      therapeutic potential in vitro. Nanocells were derived from genetically modified 
      bacteria and loaded with microRNA-34a for intravenous administration to 
      orthotopic patient-derived glioblastoma xenografts in mice. RESULTS: 
      Overexpression of microRNA-34a strongly reduced the activation status of the 
      three core signaling networks. microRNA-34a transfection also inhibited the 
      survival of multiple established glioblastoma cell lines, as well as primary 
      patient-derived xenograft cultures representing the proneural, mesenchymal and 
      classical subtypes. Transfection of microRNA-34a enhanced temozolomide (TMZ) 
      response in in vitro cultures of glioblastoma cells with primary TMZ sensitivity, 
      primary TMZ resistance and acquired TMZ resistance. Mechanistically, microRNA-34a 
      downregulated multiple therapeutic resistance genes which are associated with 
      worse survival in glioblastoma patients and are enriched in specific tumor 
      spatial compartments. Importantly, intravenous administration of nanocells 
      carrying miR-34a and targeted to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) strongly 
      enhanced TMZ sensitivity in an orthotopic patient-derived xenograft mouse model 
      of glioblastoma. CONCLUSIONS: Targeted bacterially-derived nanocells are an 
      effective vehicle for the delivery of microRNA-34a to glioblastoma tumors. 
      microRNA-34a inhibits survival and strongly sensitizes a wide range of 
      glioblastoma cell cultures to TMZ, suggesting that combination therapy of TMZ 
      with microRNA-34a loaded nanocells may serve as a novel therapeutic approach for 
      the treatment of glioblastoma tumors.

TI  - Mitochondrial metabolism supports resistance to IDH mutant inhibitors in acute 
      myeloid leukemia.
LID - 10.1084/jem.20200924 [doi]
LID - e20200924
AB  - Mutations in IDH induce epigenetic and transcriptional reprogramming, 
      differentiation bias, and susceptibility to mitochondrial inhibitors in cancer 
      cells. Here, we first show that cell lines, PDXs, and patients with acute myeloid 
      leukemia (AML) harboring an IDH mutation displayed an enhanced mitochondrial 
      oxidative metabolism. Along with an increase in TCA cycle intermediates, this 
      AML-specific metabolic behavior mechanistically occurred through the increase in 
      electron transport chain complex I activity, mitochondrial respiration, and 
      methylation-driven CEBPα-induced fatty acid β-oxidation of IDH1 mutant cells. 
      While IDH1 mutant inhibitor reduced 2-HG oncometabolite and CEBPα methylation, it 
      failed to reverse FAO and OxPHOS. These mitochondrial activities were maintained 
      through the inhibition of Akt and enhanced activation of peroxisome 
      proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1 PGC1α upon IDH1 mutant inhibitor. 
      Accordingly, OxPHOS inhibitors improved anti-AML efficacy of IDH mutant 
      inhibitors in vivo. This work provides a scientific rationale for combinatory 
      mitochondrial-targeted therapies to treat IDH mutant AML patients, especially 
      those unresponsive to or relapsing from IDH mutant inhibitors.

TI  - Epigenetic Regulation of Processes Related to High Level of Fibroblast Growth 
      Factor 21 in Obese Subjects.

AB  - We hypothesised that epigenetics may play an important role in mediating 
      fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) resistance in obesity. We aimed to evaluate 
      DNA methylation changes and miRNA pattern in obese subjects associated with high 
      serum FGF21 levels. The study included 136 participants with BMI 27-45 kg/m(2). 
      Fasting FGF21, glucose, insulin, GIP, lipids, adipokines, miokines and cytokines 
      were measured and compared in high serum FGF21 (n = 68) group to low FGF21 (n = 
      68) group. Human DNA Methylation Microarrays were analysed in leukocytes from 
      each group (n = 16). Expression of miRNAs was evaluated using quantitative 
      PCR-TLDA. The study identified differentially methylated genes in pathways 
      related to glucose transport, insulin secretion and signalling, lipid transport 
      and cellular metabolism, response to nutrient levels, thermogenesis, browning of 
      adipose tissue and bone mineralisation. Additionally, it detected transcription 
      factor genes regulating FGF21 and fibroblast growth factor receptor and vascular 
      endothelial growth factor receptor pathways regulation. Increased expression of 
      hsa-miR-875-5p and decreased expression of hsa-miR-133a-3p, hsa-miR-185-5p and 
      hsa-miR-200c-3p were found in the group with high serum FGF21. These changes were 
      associated with high FGF21, VEGF and low adiponectin serum levels. Our results 
      point to a significant role of the epigenetic regulation of genes involved in 
      metabolic pathways related to FGF21 action.

TI  - Extracellular Vesicle-Derived microRNAs of Human Wharton's Jelly Mesenchymal 
      Stromal Cells May Activate Endogenous VEGF-A to Promote Angiogenesis.
LID - 10.3390/ijms22042045 [doi]
LID - 2045
AB  - Despite low levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A, the secretome 
      of human Wharton's jelly (WJ) mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) effectively 
      promoted proangiogenic responses in vitro, which were impaired upon the depletion 
      of small (~140 nm) extracellular vesicles (EVs). The isolated EVs shared the low 
      VEGF-A profile of the secretome and expressed five microRNAs, which were 
      upregulated compared to fetal dermal MSC-derived EVs. These upregulated microRNAs 
      exclusively targeted the VEGF-A gene within 54 Gene Ontology (GO) biological 
      processes, 18 of which are associated with angiogenesis. Moreover, 15 microRNAs 
      of WJ-MSC-derived EVs were highly expressed (Ct value ≤ 26) and exclusively 
      targeted the thrombospondin 1 (THBS1) gene within 75 GO biological processes, 30 
      of which are associated with the regulation of tissue repair. The relationship 
      between predicted microRNA target genes and WJ-MSC-derived EVs was shown by 
      treating human umbilical-vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with appropriate doses 
      of EVs. The exposure of HUVECs to EVs for 72 h significantly enhanced the release 
      of VEGF-A and THBS1 protein expression compared to untreated control cells. 
      Finally, WJ-MSC-derived EVs stimulated in vitro tube formation along with the 
      migration and proliferation of HUVECs. Our findings can contribute to a better 
      understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the proangiogenic responses 
      induced by human umbilical cord-derived MSCs, suggesting a key regulatory role 
      for microRNAs delivered by EVs.

TI  - Differential miRNA Expression in Human Macrophage-Like Cells Infected with 
      Histoplasma capsulatum Yeasts Cultured in Planktonic and Biofilm Forms.
LID - 10.3390/jof7010060 [doi]
LID - 60
AB  - Histoplasma capsulatum affects healthy and immunocompromised individuals, 
      sometimes causing a severe disease. This fungus has two morphotypes, the mycelial 
      (infective) and the yeast (parasitic) phases. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNAs 
      involved in the regulation of several cellular processes, and their differential 
      expression has been associated with many disease states. To investigate miRNA 
      expression in host cells during H. capsulatum infection, we studied the changes 
      in the miRNA profiles of differentiated human macrophages infected with yeasts 
      from two fungal strains with different virulence, EH-315 (high virulence) and 60I 
      (low virulence) grown in planktonic cultures, and EH-315 grown in biofilm form. 
      MiRNA profiles were evaluated by means of reverse transcription-quantitative 
      polymerase chain reaction using a commercial human miRNome panel. The target 
      genes of the differentially expressed miRNAs and their corresponding signaling 
      pathways were predicted using bioinformatics analyses. Here, we confirmed biofilm 
      structures were present in the EH-315 culture whose conditions facilitated 
      producing insoluble exopolysaccharide and intracellular polysaccharides. In 
      infected macrophages, bioinformatics analyses revealed especially increased 
      (hsa-miR-99b-3p) or decreased (hsa-miR-342-3p) miRNAs expression levels in 
      response to infection with biofilms or both growth forms of H. capsulatum yeasts, 
      respectively. The results of miRNAs suggested that infection by H. capsulatum can 
      affect important biological pathways of the host cell, targeting two genes: one 
      encoding a protein that is important in the cortical cytoskeleton; the other, a 
      protein involved in the formation of stress granules. Expressed miRNAs in the 
      host's response could be proposed as new therapeutic and/or diagnostic tools for 
      histoplasmosis.

AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are gene expression regulators and they have been implicated 
      in acquired kidney diseases and in renal development, mostly through animal 
      studies. We hypothesized that the miR-199a/214 cluster regulates human kidney 
      development. We detected its expression in human embryonic kidneys by in situ 
      hybridization. To mechanistically study the cluster, we used 2D and 3D human 
      embryonic stem cell (hESC) models of kidney development. After confirming 
      expression in each model, we inhibited the miRNAs using lentivirally transduced 
      miRNA sponges. This reduced the WT1(+) metanephric mesenchyme domain in 2D 
      cultures. Sponges did not prevent the formation of 3D kidney-like organoids. 
      These organoids, however, contained dysmorphic glomeruli, downregulated WT1, 
      aberrant proximal tubules, and increased interstitial capillaries. Thus, the 
      miR-199a/214 cluster fine-tunes differentiation of both metanephric 
      mesenchymal-derived nephrons and kidney endothelia. While clinical implications 
      require further study, it is noted that patients with heterozygous deletions 
      encompassing this miRNA locus can have malformed kidneys.

TI  - The Inhibitory Role of miR-486-5p on CSC Phenotype Has Diagnostic and Prognostic 
      Potential in Colorectal Cancer.
LID - 10.3390/cancers12113432 [doi]
LID - 3432
AB  - Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most frequent cancer worldwide and the 
      second cause of cancer deaths. Increasing evidences supports the idea that the 
      poor prognosis of patients is related to the presence of cancer stem cells 
      (CSCs), a cell population able to drive cancer recurrence and metastasis. The 
      deregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) plays a role in the formation of CSC. We 
      investigated the role of hsa-miR-486-5p (miR-486-5p) in CRC, CSCs, and 
      metastasis, in order to reach a better understanding of the biomolecular and 
      epigenetic mechanisms mir-486-5p-related. The expression of miR-486-5p was 
      investigated in three different matrices from CRC patients and controls and in 
      CSCs obtained from the CRC cell lines HCT-116, HT-29, and T-84. In the human 
      study, miR-486-5p was up-regulated in serum and stool of CRC patients in 
      comparison with healthy controls but down-regulated in tumor tissue when compared 
      with normal mucosa. miR-486-5p was also down-regulated in the sera of metastatic 
      patients. In vitro, miR-486-5p was down-regulated in CSC models and it induced an 
      inhibitory effect on stem factors and oncogenes in the main pathways of CSCs. Our 
      results provide a step forward in understanding the role of mir-486-5p in CRC and 
      CSC, and suggest that further studies are needed to investigate its diagnostic 
      and prognostic power, possibly in combination with other biomarkers.

AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate progression of different cancers. Nevertheless, there 
      is limited information regarding the role of miR-106a-5p in renal cell carcinoma 
      (RCC). Herein, we demonstrate that miR-106a-5p levels are drastically decreased 
      in clear cell RCC (ccRCC) tissues and cell lines, which subsequently contribute 
      to a poor patient overall survival and a high tumor stage. By screening and 
      analyzing, we found that miR-106a-5p directly targets the 3'-UTR of the VEGFA 
      mRNA and led to a decrease in VEGFA. This process is important for tumor cells' 
      growth and colony formation, and overexpression of miR-106a-5p can especially 
      kill kidney tumor cells. Therefore, our data reveal that miR-106a-5p functions as 
      a tumor suppressor by regulating VEGFA and ccRCC may be susceptible to 
      miR-106a-5p therapy.

TI  - Exposure to ozone impacted Th1/Th2 imbalance of CD(4+) T cells and apoptosis of 
      ASMCs underlying asthmatic progression by activating lncRNA 
      PVT1-miR-15a-5p/miR-29c-3p signaling.
PG  - 25229-25255
LID - 10.18632/aging.104124 [doi]
AB  - This investigation attempted to elucidate whether lncRNA PVT1-led miRNA axes 
      participated in aggravating ozone-triggered asthma progression. One hundred and 
      sixty-eight BALB/c mice were evenly divided into saline+air group, ovalbumin+air 
      group, saline+ozone group and ovalbumin+ozone group. Correlations were evaluated 
      between PVT1 expression and airway smooth muscle function/inflammatory cytokine 
      release among the mice models. Furthermore, pcDNA3.1-PVT1 and si-PVT1 were, 
      respectively, transfected into CD(4+)T cells and airway smooth muscle cells 
      (ASMCs), and activities of the cells were observed. Ultimately, a cohort of 
      asthma patients was recruited to estimate the diagnostic performance of PVT1. It 
      was demonstrated that mice of ovalbumin+ozone group were associated with higher 
      PVT1 expression, thicker trachea/airway smooth muscle and smaller ratio of 
      Th1/Th2-like cytokines than mice of ovalbumin+air group and saline+ozone group 
      (P<0.05). Moreover, pcDNA3.1-PVT1 significantly brought down Th1/Th2 ratio in 
      CD(4+) T cells by depressing miR-15a-5p expression and activating PI3K-Akt-mTOR 
      signaling (P<0.05). The PVT1 also facilitated ASMC proliferation by sponging 
      miR-29c-3p and motivating PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling (P<0.05). Additionally, PVT1 
      seemed promising in diagnosis of asthma, with favorable sensitivity (i.e. 0.844) 
      and specificity (i.e. 0.978). Conclusively, lncRNA 
      PVT1-miR-15a-5p/miR-29c-3p-PI3K-Akt-mTOR axis was implicated in ozone-induced 
      asthma development by promoting ASMC proliferation and Th1/Th2 imbalance.

TI  - A "Lymphocyte MicroRNA Signature" as Predictive Biomarker of Immunotherapy 
      Response and Plasma PD-1/PD-L1 Expression Levels in Patients with Metastatic 
      Renal Cell Carcinoma: Pointing towards Epigenetic Reprogramming.
LID - 10.3390/cancers12113396 [doi]

AB  - Introduction of checkpoint inhibitors resulted in durable responses and 
      improvements in overall survival in advanced RCC patients, but the treatment 
      efficacy is widely variable, and a considerable number of patients are resistant 
      to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition. This variability of clinical response makes necessary 
      the discovery of predictive biomarkers for patient selection. Previous findings 
      showed that the epigenetic modifications, including an extensive 
      microRNA-mediated regulation of tumor suppressor genes, are key features of RCC. 
      Based on this biological background, we hypothesized that a miRNA expression 
      profile directly identified in the peripheral lymphocytes of the patients before 
      and after the nivolumab administration could represent a step toward a real-time 
      monitoring of the dynamic changes during cancer evolution and treatment. 
      Interestingly, we found a specific subset of miRNAs, called "lymphocyte miRNA 
      signature", specifically induced in long-responder patients (CR, PR, or SD to 
      nivolumab >18 months). Focusing on the clinical translational potential of miRNAs 
      in controlling the expression of immune checkpoints, we identified the 
      association between the plasma levels of soluble PD-1/PD-L1 and expression of 
      some lymphocyte miRNAs. These findings could help the development of novel 
      dynamic predictive biomarkers urgently needed to predict the potential response 
      to immunotherapy and to guide clinical decision-making in RCC patients.

TI  - Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) cardiomyocyte-secreted exosomes promote the 
      pathogenesis of DMD-associated cardiomyopathy.
LID - 10.1242/dmm.045559 [doi]
LID - dmm045559
AB  - Cardiomyopathy is a leading cause of early mortality in Duchenne muscular 
      dystrophy (DMD). There is a need to gain a better understanding of the molecular 
      pathogenesis for the development effective therapies. Exosomes (exo) are secreted 
      vesicles and exert effects via their RNA, lipid and protein cargo. The role of 
      exosomes in disease pathology is unknown. Exosomes derived from stem cells have 
      demonstrated cardioprotection in the murine DMD heart. However, it is unknown how 
      the disease status of the donor cell type influences exosome function. Here, we 
      sought to determine the phenotypic responses of DMD cardiomyocytes (DMD-iCMs) 
      after long-term exposure to DMD cardiac exosomes (DMD-exo). DMD-iCMs were 
      vulnerable to stress, evidenced by production of reactive oxygen species, the 
      mitochondrial membrane potential and cell death levels. Long-term exposure to 
      non-affected exosomes (N-exo) was protective. By contrast, long-term exposure to 
      DMD-exo was not protective, and the response to stress improved with inhibition 
      of DMD-exo secretion in vitro and in vivo The microRNA (miR) cargo, but not 
      exosome surface peptides, was implicated in the pathological effects of DMD-exo. 
      Exosomal surface profiling revealed N-exo peptides associated with PI3K-Akt 
      signaling. Transcriptomic profiling identified unique changes with exposure to 
      either N- or DMD-exo. Furthermore, DMD-exo miR cargo regulated injurious 
      pathways, including p53 and TGF-beta. The findings reveal changes in exosomal 
      cargo between healthy and diseased states, resulting in adverse outcomes. Here, 
      DMD-exo contained miR changes, which promoted the vulnerability of DMD-iCMs to 
      stress. Identification of these molecular changes in exosome cargo and effectual 
      phenotypes might shed new light on processes underlying DMD cardiomyopathy.This 
      article has an associated First Person interview with the first author of the

TI  - Circulating whole genome miRNA expression corresponds to progressive right 
      ventricle enlargement and systolic dysfunction in adults with tetralogy of 
      Fallot.
PG  - e0241476
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0241476 [doi]
LID - e0241476
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The adult congenital heart disease population with repaired 
      tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) is subject to chronic volume and pressure loading 
      leading to a 40% probability of right ventricular (RV) failure by the 3rd decade 
      of life. We sought to identify a non-invasive signature of adverse RV remodeling 
      using peripheral blood microRNA (miRNA) profiling to better understand the 
      mechanisms of RV failure. METHODS: Demographic, clinical data, and blood samples 
      were collected from adults with repaired TOF (N = 20). RNA was isolated from the 
      buffy coat of peripheral blood and whole genome miRNA expression was profiled 
      using Agilent's global miRNA microarray platform. Fold change, pathway analysis, 
      and unbiased hierarchical clustering of miRNA expression was performed and 
      correlated to RV size and function assessed by echocardiography performed at or 
      near the time of blood collection. RESULTS: MiRNA expression was profiled in the 
      following groups: 1. normal RV size (N = 4), 2. mild/moderate RV enlargement (N = 
      11) and 3. severe RV enlargement (N = 5). 267 miRNAs were downregulated, and 66 
      were upregulated across the three groups (fold change >2.0, FDR corrected p<0.05) 
      as RV enlargement increased and systolic function decreased. qPCR validation of a 
      subset of these miRNAs identified increasing expression of miRNA 28-3p, 433-3p, 
      and 371b-3p to be associated with increasing RV size and decreasing RV systolic 
      function. Unbiased hierarchical clustering of all patients based on miRNA 
      expression demonstrates three distinct patient clusters that largely coincide 
      with progressive RV enlargement. Pathway analysis of dysregulated miRNAs 
      demonstrates up and downregulation of cell cycle pathways, extracellular matrix 
      proteins and fatty acid synthesis. HIF 1α signaling was downregulated while p53 
      signaling was predicted to be upregulated. CONCLUSION: Adults with TOF have a 
      distinct miRNA profile with progressive RV enlargement and dysfunction 
      implicating cell cycle dysregulation and upregulation in extracellular matrix and 
      fatty acid metabolism. These data suggest peripheral blood miRNA can provide 
      insight into the mechanisms of RV failure and can potentially be used for 
      monitoring disease progression and to develop RV specific therapeutics to prevent 
      RV failure in TOF.

TI  - Epigenetic Programming Through Breast Milk and Its Impact on Milk-Siblings 
      Mating.
PG  - 569232
LID - 10.3389/fgene.2020.569232 [doi]
LID - 569232
AB  - BACKGROUND: The epigenetic effects of transmission of certain regulatory 
      molecules, such as miRNAs, through maternal milk on future generations, are still 
      unknown and have not been fully understood yet. We hypothesized that 
      breastfeeding regularly by adoptive-mother may cause transmission of miRNAs as 
      epigenetic regulating factors to the infant, and the marriage of milk-siblings 
      may cause various pathologies in the future generations. RESULTS: A 
      cross-fostering model using a/a and A (vy) /a mice had been established. F2 
      milk-sibling and F2 control groups were obtained from mating of milk-siblings or 
      unrelated mice. Randomized selected animals in the both F2 groups were sacrificed 
      for miRNA expression studies and the remainings were followed for phenotypic 
      changes (coat color, obesity, hyperglycemia, liver pathology, and life span). The 
      lifespan in the F2 milk-sibling group was shorter than the control group (387 vs 
      590 days, p = 0.011) and they were more obese during the aging period. 
      Histopathological examination of liver tissues revealed abnormal findings in F2 
      milk-sibling group. In order to understand the epigenetic mechanisms leading to 
      these phenotypic changes, we analyzed miRNA expression differences between 
      offspring of milk-sibling and control matings and focused on the signaling 
      pathways regulating lifespan and metabolism. Bioinformatic analysis demonstrated 
      that differentially expressed miRNAs were associated with pathways regulating 
      metabolism, survival, and cancer development such as the PI3K-Akt, ErbB, mTOR, 
      and MAPK, insulin signaling pathways. We further analyzed the expression patterns 
      of miR-186-5p, miR-141-3p, miR-345-5p, and miR-34c-5p and their candidate target 
      genes Mapk8, Gsk3b, and Ppargc1a in ovarian and liver tissues. CONCLUSION: Our 
      findings support for the first time that the factors modifying the epigenetic 
      mechanisms may be transmitted by breast milk and these epigenetic interactions 
      may be transferred transgenerationally. Results also suggested hereditary 
      epigenetic effects of cross-fostering on future generations and the impact of 
      mother-infant dyad on epigenetic programming.

TI  - Fusion-Independent Satellite Cell Communication to Muscle Fibers During 
      Load-Induced Hypertrophy.
PG  - zqaa009

LID - zqaa009
AB  - The "canonical" function of Pax7+ muscle stem cells (satellite cells) during 
      hypertrophic growth of adult muscle fibers is myonuclear donation via fusion to 
      support increased transcriptional output. In recent years, however, emerging 
      evidence suggests that satellite cells play an important secretory role in 
      promoting load-mediated growth. Utilizing genetically modified mouse models of 
      delayed satellite cell fusion and in vivo extracellular vesicle (EV) tracking, we 
      provide evidence for satellite cell communication to muscle fibers during 
      hypertrophy. Myogenic progenitor cell-EV-mediated communication to myotubes in 
      vitro influences extracellular matrix (ECM)-related gene expression, which is 
      congruent with in vivo overload experiments involving satellite cell depletion, 
      as well as in silico analyses. Satellite cell-derived EVs can transfer a 
      Cre-induced, cytoplasmic-localized fluorescent reporter to muscle cells as well 
      as microRNAs that regulate ECM genes such as matrix metalloproteinase 9 (Mmp9), 
      which may facilitate growth. Delayed satellite cell fusion did not limit 
      long-term load-induced muscle hypertrophy indicating that early 
      fusion-independent communication from satellite cells to muscle fibers is an 
      underappreciated aspect of satellite cell biology. We cannot exclude the 
      possibility that satellite cell-mediated myonuclear accretion is necessary to 
      maintain prolonged growth, specifically in the later phases of adaptation, but 
      these data collectively highlight how EV delivery from satellite cells can 
      directly contribute to mechanical load-induced muscle fiber hypertrophy, 
      independent of cell fusion to the fiber.

AB  - The use of cell secreted factors in clinical settings could be an alternative to 
      conventional cell therapy, with the advantage of limiting concerns generally 
      associated with traditional cell transplantation, such as tumorigenicity, 
      immunoreactivity, and carrying of infections. Based on our published data, we 
      predict a potential role for extracellular vesicles (EVs) in contributing to the 
      proangiogenic activity of human fetal dermal cell secretome. Depletion of 
      nanosized EVs from secretome significantly impaired its ability to induce 
      formation of mesh-like structures in vitro. The isolated EVs were characterized 
      for size and concentration by nanoparticle tracking analysis, and for protein 
      markers (Rab5(+), Alix(+), CD63(+), and calnexin(-)). The microRNA profile of EVs 
      revealed 87 microRNAs significantly upregulated (≥15-fold increase) in fetal 
      compared to adult dermal cell-derived EVs. Interestingly, these upregulated 
      microRNAs included microRNAs with a validated role in angiogenesis according to 
      literature. Moreover, the DIANA-TarBase v7.0 analysis confirmed enrichment in the 
      KEGG signaling pathways associated with angiogenesis and wound healing, with the 
      identification of putative target genes including thrombospondin 1. To validate 
      the in silico data, EVs were also characterized for total protein contents. When 
      tested in in vitro angiogenesis, fetal dermal cell-derived EVs were more 
      effective than their adult counterpart in inducing formation of complete 
      mesh-like structures. Furthermore, treatment of fibroblasts with fetal 
      dermal-derived EVs determined a 4-fold increase of thrombospondin 1 protein 
      amounts compared with the untreated fibroblasts. Finally, visualization of 
      CSFE-labeled EVs in the cytosol of target cells suggested a successful uptake of 
      these particles at 4-8 hours of incubation. We conclude that EVs are important 
      contributors of the proangiogenic effect of fetal dermal cell secretome. Hence, 
      EVs could also serve as vehicle for a successful delivery of microRNAs or other 
      molecules of therapeutic interest to target cells.

AB  - According to the growth pattern, gastric cancer (GC) could be classified into 
      expanding-type GC and infiltrative-type GC (Ming's classification). The growth 
      pattern of GC is often related to the malignant degree, invasion, metastasis, and 
      other pathological characteristics of tumors. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important 
      roles in modulating gene expression during the GC development. In this study, 
      miR-29s were significantly correlated with the gastric carcinogenesis and Ming's 
      classification. Biological function of miR-29s is most closely related to the 
      pathway of extracellular matrix (ECM)-receptor interaction. ECM structural 
      assembly, cell movement, and cell adhesion are the main functional categories of 
      target genes in this pathway. Among these targets, the COL4A1 gene ranked at the 
      top in the association analysis of combined miR-29s biological function and GC 
      subtype, and miR-29s inhibited its translation by binding to the 3' UTR region. 
      Infiltrative-type GC cells secrete a higher level of COL4A1 protein than do 
      expanding-type GC cells. The expression of COL4A1 in GC is correlated with 
      clinicopathological features. Downregulation of COL4A1 expression significantly 
      inhibited the migration and invasion of GC cells. High COL4A1 expression was 
      correlated with poor prognosis in survival analysis. The miR-29s regulatory 
      network may affect the development of growth patterns and pathological progress 
      of GC by regulating the function of COL4A1.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although there are many studies on the characteristics of miRNA-mRNA 
      interactions using miRNA and mRNA sequencing data, the complexity of the change 
      of the correlation coefficients and expression values of the miRNA-mRNA pairs 
      between tumor and normal samples is still not resolved, and this hinders the 
      potential clinical applications. There is an urgent need to develop innovative 
      methodologies and tools that can characterize and visualize functional 
      consequences of cancer risk gene and miRNA pairs while analyzing the tumor and 
      normal samples simultaneously. RESULTS: We developed an innovative bioinformatics 
      tool for visualizing functional annotation of miRNA-mRNA pairs in a network, 
      known as MMiRNA-Viewer(2). The tool takes mRNA and miRNA interaction pairs and 
      visualizes mRNA and miRNA regulation network. Moreover, our MMiRNA-Viewer(2) web 
      server integrates and displays the mRNA and miRNA gene annotation information, 
      signaling cascade pathways and direct cancer association between miRNAs and 
      mRNAs. Functional annotation and gene regulatory information can be directly 
      retrieved from our web server, which can help users quickly identify significant 
      interaction sub-network and report possible disease or cancer association. The 
      tool can identify pivotal miRNAs or mRNAs that contribute to the complexity of 
      cancer, while engaging modern next-generation sequencing technology to analyze 
      the tumor and normal samples concurrently. We compared our tools with other 
      visualization tools. CONCLUSION: Our MMiRNA-Viewer(2) serves as a multitasking 
      platform in which users can identify significant interaction clusters and 
      retrieve functional and cancer-associated information for miRNA-mRNA pairs 
      between tumor and normal samples. Our tool is applicable across a range of 
      diseases and cancers and has advantages over existing tools.

AB  - Complex interactions between mRNAs and microRNAs influence cellular functions. 
      The mRNA-microRNA interactions also determine the post-transcriptional 
      availability of mRNAs and unbound microRNAs. MicroRNAs binds to one or more 
      microRNA response elements (MREs) located on the 3'UTR of mRNAs. In this study, 
      we leveraged MREs and their frequencies in cancer and matched normal tissues to 
      obtain insights into disease-specific interactions between mRNAs and microRNAs. 
      We developed a bioinformatics method "ReMIx" that utilizes RNA sequencing 
      (RNA-Seq) data to quantify MRE frequencies across the transcriptome. We applied 
      ReMIx to triple-negative (TN) breast cancer tumor-normal adjacent pairs and 
      identified MREs specific to TN tumors. ReMIx identified candidate mRNAs and 
      microRNAs in the MAPK signaling cascade. Further analysis of MAPK gene regulatory 
      networks revealed microRNA partners that influence and modulate MAPK signaling. 
      In conclusion, we demonstrate a novel method of using MREs in the identification 
      of functionally relevant mRNA-microRNA interactions in TN breast cancer.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) is a significant adverse pregnancy 
      complication, with an incompletely understood pathology. While many entities were 
      proposed to elucidate the pathogenic basis of RPL, only few were significant 
      enough to warrant investigation in all affected couples.. The aim of this study 
      was to provide novel insights into the biological characteristics and related 
      pathways of differentially expressed miRNA (DEMs) and genes (DEGs), in RPL, and 
      construct a molecular miRNAs-mRNAs network. METHODS: miRNAs and gene expression 
      data were collected, and a number of DEMs and (DEGs) were obtained, and 
      regulatory co-expression network were constructed. Function and enrichment 
      analyses of DEMs were conducted using DIANA-miRPath. DEGs were screened, and were 
      used in generation of protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, using STRING 
      online database. Modularity analysis, and pathway identification operations were 
      used in identifying graph clusters and associated pathways. DEGs were also used 
      for further gene ontology (GO) analysis, followed by analysis of KEGG pathway. 
      RESULTS: A total of 34 DEMs were identified, and were found to be highly enriched 
      in TGF-β signaling pathway, Fatty acid metabolism and TNF signaling pathway. Hub 
      miRNAs were selected and were found to be involved in several functional pathways 
      including progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation and Thyroid hormone signaling 
      pathway. Five dysregulated feedback loops involving miRNA and TFs were identified 
      and characterized. Most notably, PPI network analysis identified hub-bottleneck 
      protein panel. These appear to offer potential candidate biomarker pattern for 
      RPL diagnosis and treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The present study provides novel 
      insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying RPL.

TI  - MicroRNA-934 is a novel primate-specific small non-coding RNA with neurogenic 
      function during early development.
LID - 10.7554/eLife.50561 [doi]
LID - e50561
AB  - Integrating differential RNA and miRNA expression during neuronal lineage 
      induction of human embryonic stem cells we identified miR-934, a primate-specific 
      miRNA that displays a stage-specific expression pattern during progenitor 
      expansion and early neuron generation. We demonstrate the biological relevance of 
      this finding by comparison with data from early to mid-gestation human cortical 
      tissue. Further we find that miR-934 directly controls progenitor to neuroblast 
      transition and impacts on neurite growth of newborn neurons. In agreement, 
      miR-934 targets are involved in progenitor proliferation and neuronal 
      differentiation whilst miR-934 inhibition results in profound global 
      transcriptome changes associated with neurogenesis, axonogenesis, neuronal 
      migration and neurotransmission. Interestingly, miR-934 inhibition affects the 
      expression of genes associated with the subplate zone, a transient compartment 
      most prominent in primates that emerges during early corticogenesis. Our data 
      suggest that mir-934 is a novel regulator of early human neurogenesis with 
      potential implications for a species-specific evolutionary role in brain 
      function.

TI  - Cardiovascular Risk and Resilience Among Black Adults: Rationale and Design of 
      the MECA Study.
PG  - e015247
LID - 10.1161/JAHA.119.015247 [doi]
LID - e015247
AB  - Background Cardiovascular disease incidence, prevalence, morbidity, and mortality 
      have declined in the past several decades; however, disparities persist among 
      subsets of the population. Notably, blacks have not experienced the same 
      improvements on the whole as whites. Furthermore, frequent reports of relatively 
      poorer health statistics among the black population have led to a broad 
      assumption that black race reliably predicts relatively poorer health outcomes. 
      However, substantial intraethnic and intraracial heterogeneity exists; moreover, 
      individuals with similar risk factors and environmental exposures are often known 
      to experience vastly different cardiovascular health outcomes. Thus, some 
      individuals have good outcomes even in the presence of cardiovascular risk 
      factors, a concept known as resilience. Methods and Results The MECA 
      (Morehouse-Emory Center for Health Equity) Study was designed to investigate the 
      multilevel exposures that contribute to "resilience" in the face of risk for poor 
      cardiovascular health among blacks in the greater Atlanta, GA, metropolitan area. 
      We used census tract data to determine "at-risk" and "resilient" neighborhoods 
      with high or low prevalence of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, based on 
      cardiovascular death, hospitalization, and emergency department visits for 
      blacks. More than 1400 individuals from these census tracts assented to 
      demographic, health, and psychosocial questionnaires administered through 
      telephone surveys. Afterwards, ≈500 individuals were recruited to enroll in a 
      clinical study, where risk biomarkers, such as oxidative stress, and inflammatory 
      markers, endothelial progenitor cells, metabolomic and microRNA profiles, and 
      subclinical vascular dysfunction were measured. In addition, comprehensive 
      behavioral questionnaires were collected and ideal cardiovascular health metrics 
      were assessed using the American Heart Association's Life Simple 7 measure. Last, 
      150 individuals with low Life Simple 7 were recruited and randomized to a 
      behavioral mobile health (eHealth) plus health coach or eHealth only intervention 
      and followed up for improvement. Conclusions The MECA Study is investigating 
      socioenvironmental and individual behavioral measures that promote resilience to 
      cardiovascular disease in blacks by assessing biological, functional, and 
      molecular mechanisms. REGISTRATION URL: https://www.clini​caltr​ials.gov. Unique

TI  - forgeNet: a graph deep neural network model using tree-based ensemble classifiers 
      for feature graph construction.
PG  - 3507-3515
LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa164 [doi]
AB  - MOTIVATION: A unique challenge in predictive model building for omics data has 
      been the small number of samples (n) versus the large amount of features (p). 
      This 'n≪p' property brings difficulties for disease outcome classification using 
      deep learning techniques. Sparse learning by incorporating known functional 
      relationships between the biological units, such as the graph-embedded deep 
      feedforward network (GEDFN) model, has been a solution to this issue. However, 
      such methods require an existing feature graph, and potential mis-specification 
      of the feature graph can be harmful on classification and feature selection. 
      RESULTS: To address this limitation and develop a robust classification model 
      without relying on external knowledge, we propose a forest graph-embedded deep 
      feedforward network (forgeNet) model, to integrate the GEDFN architecture with a 
      forest feature graph extractor, so that the feature graph can be learned in a 
      supervised manner and specifically constructed for a given prediction task. To 
      validate the method's capability, we experimented the forgeNet model with both 
      synthetic and real datasets. The resulting high classification accuracy suggests 
      that the method is a valuable addition to sparse deep learning models for omics 
      data. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The method is available at 
      https://github.com/yunchuankong/forgeNet. CONTACT: tianwei.yu@emory.edu.

TI  - Discovery of inflammatory bowel disease-associated miRNAs using a novel bipartite 
      clustering approach.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Multidimensional data mining from an integrated environment of 
      different data sources is frequently performed in computational system biology. 
      The molecular mechanism from the analysis of a complex network of gene-miRNA can 
      aid to diagnosis and treatment of associated diseases. METHODS: In this work, we 
      mainly focus on finding inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) associated microRNAs 
      (miRNAs) by biclustering the miRNA-target interactions aided by known IBD risk 
      genes and their associated miRNAs collected from several sources. We rank 
      different miRNAs by attributing to the dataset size and connectivity of IBD 
      associated genes in the miRNA regulatory modules from biclusters. We search the 
      association of some top-ranking miRNAs to IBD related diseases. We also search 
      the network of discovered miRNAs to different diseases and evaluate the 
      similarity of those diseases to IBD. RESULTS: According to different literature, 
      our results show the significance of top-ranking miRNA to IBD or related 
      diseases. The ratio analysis supports our ranking method where the top 20 miRNA 
      has approximately tenfold attachment to IBD genes. From disease-associated miRNA 
      network analysis we found that 71% of different diseases attached to those miRNAs 
      show more than 0.75 similarity scores to IBD. CONCLUSION: We successfully 
      identify some miRNAs related to IBD where the scoring formula and 
      disease-associated network analysis show the significance of our method. This 
      method can be a promising approach for isolating miRNAs for similar types of 
      diseases.

AB  - Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) causes serious respiratory tract illness and 
      substantial morbidity and some mortality in populations at the extremes of age, 
      i.e., infants, young children, and the elderly. To date, RSV vaccine development 
      has been unsuccessful, a feature linked to the lack of biomarkers available to 
      assess the safety and efficacy of RSV vaccine candidates. We examined microRNAs 
      (miR) as potential biomarkers for different types of RSV vaccine candidates. In 
      this study, mice were vaccinated with a live attenuated RSV candidate that lacks 
      the small hydrophobic (SH) and attachment (G) proteins (CP52), an RSV G protein 
      microparticle (GA2-MP) vaccine, a formalin-inactivated RSV (FI-RSV) vaccine or 
      were mock-treated. Several immunological endpoints and miR expression profiles 
      were determined in mouse serum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) following vaccine 
      priming, boost, and RSV challenge. We identified miRs that were linked with 
      immunological parameters of disease and protection. We show that miRs are 
      potential biomarkers providing valuable insights for vaccine development.

TI  - The Role of Salivary miR-134-3p and miR-15b-5p as Potential Non-invasive 
      Predictors for Not Developing Acute Mountain Sickness.
PG  - 898
LID - 10.3389/fphys.2019.00898 [doi]
LID - 898
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute mountain sickness (AMS) is a crucial public health problem for 
      high altitude travelers. Discriminating individuals who are not developing (AMS 
      resistance, AMS-) from developing AMS (AMS susceptibility, AMS+) at baseline 
      would be vital for disease prevention. Salivary microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged 
      as promising non-invasive biomarkers for various diseases. Thus, the aim of our 
      study was to identify the potential roles of salivary miRNAs in identifying AMS- 
      individuals pre-exposed to high altitude. Moreover, as hypoxia is the triggering 
      factor for AMS, present study also explored the association between cerebral 
      tissue oxygenation indices (TOI) and AMS development after exposed to high 
      altitude, which was the complementary aim. METHODS: In this study, 124 healthy 
      men were recruited, and were exposed at simulated high altitude of 4,500 m. 
      Salivary miR-134-3p and miR-15b-5p were measured at baseline (200 m). AMS was 
      diagnosed based on Lake Louise Scoring System at 4,500 m. The measurements of 
      physiological parameters were recorded at both the altitudes. RESULTS: Salivary 
      miR-134-3p and miR-15b-5p were significantly up-regulated in AMS- individuals as 
      compared to the AMS+ (p < 0.05). In addition, the combination of these miRNAs 
      generated a high power for discriminating the AMS- from AMS+ at baseline (AUC: 
      0.811, 95% CI: 0.731-0.876, p < 0.001). Moreover, the value of cerebral TOIs at 
      4,500 m were significantly higher in AMS- individuals, compared to AMS+ (p < 
      0.01). CONCLUSION: Our study reveals for the first time that salivary miR-134-3p 
      and miR-15b-5p can be used as non-invasive biomarkers for predicting AMS- 
      individuals pre-exposed to high altitude.

AB  - Excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated in mitochondria is known to be 
      a causal event in diabetic cardiomyopathy. Recent studies suggest that microRNAs 
      (miRNAs) are able to translocate to mitochondria to modulate mitochondrial 
      activities, but the roles of such miRNAs in diabetic cardiomyopathy remain 
      unclear. We observed a marked reduction of mitochondrial gene cytochrome-b 
      (mt-Cytb) in the heart of db/db mice compared with controls. Downregulation of 
      mt-Cytb by small interfering RNA (siRNA) recaptured some key features of 
      diabetes, including elevated ROS production. Microarray revealed that none of the 
      miRNAs were upregulated, but 14 miRNAs were downregulated in mitochondria of 
      db/db heart. miR-92a-2-5p and let-7b-5p targeted mt-Cytb and positively modulated 
      mt-Cytb expression. Re-expression of miR-92a-2-5p and let-7b-5p into 
      cardiomyocytes led to reduced ROS production. Furthermore, recombinant 
      adeno-associated virus (rAAV)-mediated delivery of miR-92a-2-5p, but not 
      let-7b-5p, was sufficient to rescue cardiac diastolic dysfunction in db/db heart. 
      Let-7b-5p not only upregulated mt-Cytb in mitochondria, but also downregulated 
      insulin receptor substrate 1 in cytosol and finally lead to no efficiency for 
      improvement of diastolic dysfunction in db/db mice. Our findings demonstrate that 
      reduced mitochondrial miRNAs contribute to impaired mitochondrial gene expression 
      and elevated ROS production. Re-expression of miR-92a-2-5p enhances mitochondrial 
      translation and reduces ROS production and lipid deposition, which finally 
      rescues diabetic cardiomyopathy.

AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNA molecules with important roles in 
      post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. In recent years, the 
      predicted number of miRNAs has skyrocketed, largely as a consequence of 
      high-throughput sequencing technologies becoming ubiquitous. This dramatic 
      increase in miRNA candidates poses multiple challenges in terms of data 
      deposition, curation, and validation. Although multiple databases containing 
      miRNA annotations and targets have been developed, ensuring data quality by 
      validating miRNA-target interactions requires the efforts of the research 
      community. In order to generate databases containing biologically active miRNAs, 
      it is imperative to overcome a multitude of hurdles, including restricted miRNA 
      expression patterns, distinct miRNA biogenesis machineries, and divergent 
      miRNA-mRNA interaction dynamics. In the present review, we discuss recent 
      advances and limitations in miRNA prediction, identification, and validation. 
      Lastly, we focus on the most enriched neuronal miRNA, miR-124, and its gene 
      regulatory network in human neurons, which has been revealed using a combined 
      computational and experimental approach.

TI  - PITX2 enhances progression of lung adenocarcinoma by transcriptionally regulating 
      WNT3A and activating Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.
PG  - 96

LID - 96
AB  - BACKGROUND: The homeodomain transcription factor, PITX2 is associated with 
      tumorigenesis of multiple cancers. In this research, we aimed to study the 
      expression, function and mechanism of PITX2 in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). 
      METHODS: The TCGA dataset was used to analyze the expression and clinical 
      significance of PITX2 in LUAD. The expression of PITX2 in tumor samples and LUAD 
      cell lines was examined by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and western 
      blotting. Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) were constructed to knockdown PITX2 and 
      to determine the physiological function of PITX2 in vitro. Xenograft model was 
      used to confirm the role of PITX2 in vivo. RESULTS: PITX2 was overexpressed in 
      LUAD and patients with high level of PITX2 had a worse overall survival and an 
      advanced clinical stage. Knockdown of PITX2 inhibited cell proliferation, 
      migration and invasion of LUAD cells. Further study revealed that the oncogenic 
      role of PITX2 was dependent on activating Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, 
      especially by transcriptionally regulating the Wnt gene family member, WNT3A. 
      Lastly, we identified miR-140-5p as a negative mediator of PITX2 by binding its 
      3'UTR and ectopic expression of miR-140-5p inhibited progression of LUAD cells 
      via suppressing the expression of PITX2. CONCLUSIONS: Up-regulation of PITX2 acts 
      as an oncogene in LUAD by activating Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, suggesting 
      that PITX2 may serve as a novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in LUAD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Approximately 5-20% of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients 
      demonstrate primary resistance or intolerance to imatinib. None of the existing 
      predictive scores gives a good prognosis of TKI efficacy. Gene polymorphisms, 
      expression and microRNAs are known to be involved in the pathogenesis of TKI 
      resistance in CML. The aim of our study is to find new molecular markers of TKI 
      therapy efficacy in CML patients. METHODS: Newly diagnosed patients with Ph+ CML 
      in chronic phase were included in this study. Optimal and non-optimal responses 
      to TKI were estimated according to ELN 2013 recommendation. We performed 
      genotyping of selected polymorphisms in 62 blood samples of CML patients, 
      expression profiling of 33 RNA samples extracted from blood and miRNA profiling 
      of 800 miRNA in 12 blood samples of CML patients. RESULTS: The frequencies of 
      genotypes at the studied loci did not differ between groups of patients with an 
      optimal and non-optimal response to TKI therapy. Analysis of the expression of 
      34,681 genes revealed 26 differently expressed genes (p < 0.05) in groups of 
      patients with different TKI responses, but differences were very small and were 
      not confirmed by qPCR. Finally, we did not find difference in miRNA expression 
      between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Using modern high-throughput methods such as 
      whole-exome sequencing, transcriptome and miRNA analysis, we could not find 
      reliable molecular markers for early prediction of TKI efficiency in Ph+ CML 
      patients.

AB  - Certain microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) may be used as prognostic biomarkers in various 
      types of cancer. The purpose of the present study was to identify miRNAs that 
      were abnormally expressed in glioma of different grades, and to evaluate their 
      clinical implications in patients with glioma. The differentially expressed 
      miRNAs were evaluated from the expression profiles of six glioma tissues (three 
      low-grade and three high-grade gliomas) determined using a microarray platform. 
      Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis was used to 
      further verify the aberrant expression of the candidate miRNA in a set of 42 
      patients and 5 healthy controls. The miRNA target genes were predicted and the 
      protein-protein interaction network was generated; furthermore, functional 
      enrichment analysis of the target genes in Gene Ontology (GO) terms and Kyoto 
      Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways was performed. Kaplan-Meier 
      curves and Log-rank analysis, as well as multivariate Cox regression analysis 
      were performed to assess the association of the candidate miRNA with patient 
      survival. A total of 15 differentially expressed miRNAs, including 13 
      downregulated and 2 upregulated miRNAs, were identified by comparison of 
      low-grade and high-grade glioma tissues. The miR-374a expression of high-grade 
      gliomas was significantly lower than that of low-grade gliomas (fold change, 
      -4.43; P=0.027). The expression levels of miR-374a gradually decreased with the 
      increase of the pathological grade of glioma. Pearson's Chi-square test was used 
      to determine the association of miR-374a expression with several 
      clinicopathological factors. Furthermore, low expression of miR-374a was 
      determined to be an independent prognostic marker and that it was significantly 
      associated with overall survival (P=0.0213). GO and KEGG pathway analysis 
      revealed that the target genes of miR-374a may be involved in the regulation of 
      the RNA polymerase II promoter and mTOR signaling pathway. The four hub genes 
      (CCND1, SP1, CDK4, CDK6) were also identified by PPI network analysis. In 
      conclusion, the present study indicated that miR-374a may be used as a promising 
      prognostic biomarker for the screening of high-risk populations and for the 
      assessment of the prognosis of patients with glioma.

AB  - Heart failure is a worldwide leading cause of death. Diet and obesity are 
      particularly of high concern in heart disease etiology. Gravely, altered 
      nutrition during developmental windows of vulnerability can have long-term impact 
      on heart health; however, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. In the 
      understanding of the initiation of chronic diseases related to developmental 
      exposure to environmental challenges, deregulations in epigenetic mechanisms 
      including micro-RNAs have been proposed as key events. In this context, we aimed 
      at delineating the role of micro-RNAs in the programming of cardiac alterations 
      induced by early developmental exposure to nutritional imbalance. To reach our 
      aim, we developed a human relevant model of developmental exposure to nutritional 
      imbalance by maternally exposing rat to high-fat diet during gestation and 
      lactation. In this model, offspring exposed to maternal high-fat diet developed 
      cardiac hypertrophy and increased extracellular matrix depot compared to those 
      exposed to chow diet. Microarray approach performed on cardiac tissue allowed the 
      identification of a micro-RNA subset which was down-regulated in high-fat 
      diet-exposed animals and which were predicted to regulate transforming growth 
      factor-beta (TGFβ)-mediated remodeling. As indicated by in vitro approaches and 
      gene expression measurement in the heart of our animals, decrease in DiGeorge 
      critical region 8 (DGCR8) expression, involved in micro-RNA biogenesis, seems to 
      be a critical point in the alterations of the micro-RNA profile and the 
      TGFβ-mediated remodeling induced by maternal exposure to high-fat diet. Finally, 
      increasing DGCR8 activity and/or expression through hemin treatment in vitro 
      revealed its potential in the rescue of the pro-fibrotic phenotype in 
      cardiomyocytes driven by DGCR8 decrease. These findings suggest that cardiac 
      alterations induced by maternal exposure to high-fat diet is related to 
      abnormalities in TGFβ pathway and associated with down-regulated micro-RNA 
      processing. Our study highlighted DGCR8 as a potential therapeutic target for 
      heart diseases related to early exposure to dietary challenge.

AB  - BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (MiRs) play an important role in the pathogenesis of 
      chronic inflammatory diseases. This study is the first to investigate miR 
      expression profiles in purified CD4(+) T lymphocytes and CD14(+) monocytes from 
      patients with axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) using a high-throughput qPCR 
      approach. METHODS: A total of 81 axSpA patients fulfilling the 2009 ASAS 
      classification criteria, and 55 controls were recruited from October 2014 to July 
      2017. CD14(+) monocytes and CD4(+) T lymphocytes were isolated from peripheral 
      blood mononuclear cells. MiR expression was investigated by qPCR using the Exiqon 
      Human MiRnome panel I analyzing 372 miRNAs. Differentially expressed miRNAs 
      identified in the discovery cohort were validated in the replication cohort. 
      RESULTS: We found a major difference in miR expression patterns between T 
      lymphocytes and monocytes regardless of the patient or control status. Comparing 
      disease-specific differentially expressed miRs, 13 miRs were found consistently 
      deregulated in CD14(+) cells in both cohorts with miR-361-3p, miR-223-3p, 
      miR-484, and miR-16-5p being the most differentially expressed. In CD4(+) T 
      cells, 11 miRs were differentially expressed between patients and controls with 
      miR-16-1-3p, miR-28-5p, miR-199a-5p, and miR-126-3p were the most strongly 
      upregulated miRs among patients. These miRs are involved in disease relevant 
      pathways such as inflammation, intestinal permeability or bone formation. 
      Mir-146a-5p levels correlated inversely with the degree of inflammation in axSpA 
      patients. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate a consistent deregulation of miRs in both 
      monocytes and CD4(+) T cells from axSpA patients, which could contribute to the 
      pathophysiology of the disease with potential interest from a therapeutic 
      perspective.

TI  - Neuroprotective effect of placenta-derived mesenchymal stromal cells: role of 
      exosomes.
PG  - 5836-5849
LID - 10.1096/fj.201800972R [doi]
AB  - We have established early-gestation chorionic villus-derived placenta mesenchymal 
      stromal cells (PMSCs) as a potential treatment for spina bifida (SB), a neural 
      tube defect. Our preclinical studies demonstrated that PMSCs have the potential 
      to cure hind limb paralysis in the fetal lamb model of SB via a paracrine 
      mechanism. PMSCs exhibit neuroprotective function by increasing cell number and 
      neurites, as shown by indirect coculture and direct addition of PMSC-conditioned 
      medium to the staurosporine-induced apoptotic human neuroblastoma cell line, 
      SH-SY5Y. PMSC-conditioned medium suppressed caspase activity in apoptotic SH-SY5Y 
      cells, suggesting that PMSC secretome contributes to neuronal survival after 
      injury. As a part of PMSC secretome, PMSC exosomes were isolated and extensively 
      characterized; their addition to apoptotic SH-SY5Y cells mediated an increase in 
      neurites, suggesting that they exhibit neuroprotective function. Proteomic and 
      RNA sequencing analysis revealed that PMSC exosomes contain several proteins and 
      RNAs involved in neuronal survival and development. Galectin 1 was highly 
      expressed on the surface of PMSCs and PMSC exosomes. Preincubation of exosomes 
      with anti-galectin 1 antibody decreased their neuroprotective effect, suggesting 
      that PMSC exosomes likely impart their effect via binding of galectin 1 to cells. 
      Future studies will include in-depth analyses of the role of PMSC exosomes on 
      neuroprotection and their clinical applications.-Kumar, P., Becker, J. C., Gao,

AB  - Breast ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) has been typically recognized by 
      pathologists on the basis of aberrant mammary duct morphology. Thus, there are 
      increasing efforts to detect DCIS biomarkers and druggable targets. In this study 
      we focused on the molecular mechanism involving Annexin A8 (ANXA8), a Ca(2+) and 
      phospholipid binding protein, which is regulated by all-trans Retinoic Acid (RA), 
      and it is highly expressed in breast DCIS tissue samples relative to atypical 
      ductal hyperplasia, and normal breast tissue. Using a panel of human mammary 
      epithelial HME1 cell lines that share a common protein signature, and develop in 
      vitro three dimensional (3D) "DCIS-like" amorphous structures, we identified by 
      bioinformatics analysis protein-miRNA pairs, potentially involved in mammary 
      morphogenetic mechanisms, including the ANXA8 mechanism. HME1 cells with genetic 
      mutations hampering the physiological RA regulation of the RA receptor alpha 
      (RARA) transcriptional function, but retain the RARA function controlling the 
      PI3KCA-AKT signaling, develop 3D "DCIS-like" amorphous structures with 
      upregulated ANXA8. Consistently, ectopic ANXA8 expression, by affecting the RARA 
      transcriptional function, induced HME1 DCIS-like amorphous acini expressing 
      phosphorylated AKT (P-AKT). Apparently, a RA-RARA-ANXA8 feedback loop fosters a 
      vicious circle of aberrant morphogenesis. Interestingly, a few miRNAs regulated 
      by RA are predicted to target ANXA8 mRNA. These miRNAs are candidate components 
      of the RA-RARA-ANXA8 mechanism, and their deregulation might induce DCIS 
      initiation.

PG  - 534

LID - 534
AB  - Background: The diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) relies on behavioral 
      assessment. Efforts to define biomarkers of ASD have not resulted in an 
      objective, reliable test. Studies of RNA levels in ASD have demonstrated 
      potential utility, but have been limited by a focus on single RNA types, small 
      sample sizes, and lack of developmental delay controls. We hypothesized that a 
      saliva-based poly-"omic" RNA panel could objectively distinguish children with 
      ASD from their neurotypical peers and children with non-ASD developmental delay. 
      Methods: This multi-center cross-sectional study included 456 children, ages 
      19-83 months. Children were either neurotypical (n = 134) or had a diagnosis of 
      ASD (n = 238), or non-ASD developmental delay (n = 84). Comprehensive human and 
      microbial RNA abundance was measured in the saliva of all participants using 
      unbiased next generation sequencing. Prior to analysis, the sample was randomly 
      divided into a training set (82% of subjects) and an independent validation test 
      set (18% of subjects). The training set was used to develop an RNA-based 
      algorithm that distinguished ASD and non-ASD children. The validation set was not 
      used in model development (feature selection or training) but served only to 
      validate empirical accuracy. Results: In the training set (n = 372; mean age 51 
      months; 75% male; 51% ASD), a set of 32 RNA features (controlled for demographic 
      and medical characteristics), identified ASD status with a cross-validated area 
      under the curve (AUC) of 0.87 (95% CI: 0.86-0.88). In the completely separate 
      validation test set (n = 84; mean age 50 months; 85% male; 60% ASD), the 
      algorithm maintained an AUC of 0.88 (82% sensitivity and 88% specificity). 
      Notably, the RNA features were implicated in physiologic processes related to ASD 
      (axon guidance, neurotrophic signaling). Conclusion: Salivary poly-omic RNA 
      measurement represents a novel, non-invasive approach that can accurately 
      identify children with ASD. This technology could improve the specificity of 
      referrals for ASD evaluation or provide objective support for ASD diagnoses.

TI  - Diagnosis of traumatic brain injury using miRNA signatures in nanomagnetically 
      isolated brain-derived extracellular vesicles.
PG  - 3617-3630
LID - 10.1039/c8lc00672e [doi]
AB  - The accurate diagnosis and clinical management of traumatic brain injury (TBI) is 
      currently limited by the lack of accessible molecular biomarkers that reflect the 
      pathophysiology of this heterogeneous disease. To address this challenge, we 
      developed a microchip diagnostic that can characterize TBI more comprehensively 
      using the RNA found in brain-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs). Our approach 
      measures a panel of EV miRNAs, processed with machine learning algorithms to 
      capture the state of the injured and recovering brain. Our diagnostic combines 
      surface marker-specific nanomagnetic isolation of brain-derived EVs, biomarker 
      discovery using RNA sequencing, and machine learning processing of the EV miRNA 
      cargo to minimally invasively measure the state of TBI. We achieved an accuracy 
      of 99% identifying the signature of injured vs. sham control mice using an 
      independent blinded test set (N = 77), where the injured group consists of 
      heterogeneous populations (injury intensity, elapsed time since injury) to model 
      the variability present in clinical samples. Moreover, we successfully predicted 
      the intensity of the injury, the elapsed time since injury, and the presence of a 
      prior injury using independent blinded test sets (N = 82). We demonstrated the 
      translatability in a blinded test set by identifying TBI patients from healthy 
      controls (AUC = 0.9, N = 60). This approach, which can detect signatures of 
      injury that persist across a variety of injury types and individual responses to 
      injury, more accurately reflects the heterogeneity of human TBI injury and 
      recovery than conventional diagnostics, opening new opportunities to improve 
      treatment of traumatic brain injuries.

AB  - The dengue virus (DENV), transmitted by Aedes spp. mosquitoes, is one of the most 
      important arboviral infections in the world. Dengue begins as a febrile 
      condition, and in certain patients, it can evolve severe clinical outcomes, such 
      as dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). The reasons 
      why certain patients develop DHF or DSS have not been thoroughly elucidated to 
      date, and both patient and viral factors have been implicated. Previous work has 
      shown that a severe immune dysfunction involving dendritic cells and T cells 
      plays a key role in increasing the disease severity, especially in secondary 
      heterologous infections. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membranous particles 
      that are secreted by several cell types involved in homeostatic and pathological 
      processes. Secretion of EVs by infected cells can enhance immune responses or 
      favor viral evasion. In this study, we compare the molecular content of EVs that 
      are secreted by human primary dendritic cells under different conditions: 
      uninfected or infected with DENV3 strains isolated from patients with different 
      infection phenotypes (a severe case involving DSS and a mild case). Human 
      monocyte-derived dendritic cells (mdDCs) were infected with the dengue virus 
      strains DENV3 5532 (severe) or DENV3 290 (mild), and the EVs were isolated. The 
      presence of cup-shaped EVs was confirmed by electron microscopy and 
      immunostaining with CD9, CD81, and CD83. The RNA content from the mdDC-infected 
      cells contained several mRNAs and miRNAs related to immune responses compared to 
      the EVs from mock-infected mdDCs. A number of these RNAs were detected 
      exclusively during infection with DENV3 290 or DENV3 5532. This result suggests 
      that the differential immune modulation of mdDCs by dengue strains can be 
      achieved through the EV pathway. Additionally, we observed an association of EVs 
      with DENV-infectious particles that seem to be protected from antibodies 
      targeting the DENV envelope protein. We also showed that EVs derived from cells 
      treated with IFN alpha have a protective effect against DENV infection in other 
      cells. These results suggested that during DENV infection, the EV pathway could 
      be exploited to favor viral viability, although immune mechanisms to counteract 
      viral infection can also involve DC-derived EVs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Little has been known about the role of non-coding RNA regulatory 
      network in the patterns of growth and invasiveness of gastric cancer (GC) 
      development. METHODS: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) microarray was used to screen 
      differential miRNA expression profiles in Ming's classification. The significant 
      differential expressions of representative miRNAs and their interacting circular 
      RNA (circRNA) were confirmed in GC cell line and 63 pairs of GC samples. Then, a 
      circRNA/miRNA network was constructed by bioinformatics approaches to identify 
      molecular pathways. Finally, we explored the clinical value of the common targets 
      in the pathway by using receiver operating characteristic curve and survival 
      analysis. RESULTS: Significantly differential expressed miRNAs were found in two 
      pathological types of GC. Both of miR-124 and miR-29b were consistently 
      down-regulated in GC. CircHIPK3 could play a negative regulatory role on 
      miR-124/miR-29b expression and associated with T stage and Ming's classification 
      in GC. The bioinformatics analyses showed that targets expression of 
      circHIPK3-miR-124/miR-29b axes in cancer-related pathways was able to predict the 
      status of GC and associated with individual survival time. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      targets of circHIPK3-miR-124/miR-29b axes involved in the progression of GC. 
      CircHIPK3 could take part in the proliferation process of GC cell and may be 
      potential biomarker in histological classification of GC.

TI  - Single Cell Analysis Identifies the miRNA Expression Profile of a Subpopulation

AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) take part in regulating central cellular processes such as 
      differentiation and metabolism. We have previously shown that muscle progenitor 
      cells derived from individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) have a dysregulated 
      miRNA profile. We hypothesized that the T2DM muscle progenitor population is 
      heterogeneous in its miRNA expression and differs from the progenitor population 
      of healthy controls. MiRNA expression profiles of CD56+ muscle progenitor cells 
      from people with T2DM and from healthy controls were therefore investigated at a 
      single cell level. Single-cell analysis revealed three subpopulations expressing 
      distinct miRNA profiles: two subpopulations including both T2DM and healthy 
      control muscle precursors presented miRNA expression profiles mostly overlapping 
      between groups. A distinct third subpopulation consisted solely of cells from 
      donors with T2DM and showed enriched expression of miRNAs previously shown to be 
      associated with type 2 diabetes. Among the enriched miRNAs was miR-29, a 
      regulator of GLUT4 mRNA expression. Interestingly, this subpopulation also 
      revealed several miRNAs with predicted targets in the PI3K/Akt pathway, not 
      previously described in relation to T2DM muscle dysfunction. We concluded that a 
      subpopulation of T2DM muscle precursor cells is severely dysregulated in terms of 
      their miRNA expression, and accumulation of this population might thus contribute 
      to the dysfunctional muscular phenotype in type 2 diabetes.

TI  - MicroRNA Expression Profiling in the Prefrontal Cortex: Putative Mechanisms for 
      the Cognitive Effects of Adolescent High Fat Feeding.
PG  - 8344

LID - 8344
AB  - The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), master regulator of higher-order cognitive 
      functions, is the only brain region that matures until late adolescence. During 
      this period, the mPFC is sensitive to stressful events or suboptimal nutrition. 
      For instance, high-fat diet (HFD) feeding during adolescence markedly impairs 
      prefrontal-dependent cognition. It also provokes multiple changes at the cellular 
      and synaptic scales within the mPFC, suggesting that major transcriptional events 
      are elicited by HFD during this maturational period. The nature of this 
      transcriptional reprogramming remains unknown, but may include epigenetic 
      processes, in particular microRNAs, known to directly regulate synaptic 
      functions. We used high-throughput screening in the adolescent mouse mPFC and 
      identified 38 microRNAs differentially regulated by HFD, in particular 
      mir-30e-5p. We used a luciferase assay to confirm the functional effect of 
      mir-30e-5p on a chosen target: Ephrin-A3. Using global pathway analyses of 
      predicted microRNA targets, we identified biological pathways putatively affected 
      by HFD. Axon guidance was the top-1 pathway, validated by identifying gene 
      expression changes of axon guidance molecules following HFD. Our findings 
      delineate major microRNA transcriptional reprogramming within the mPFC induced by 
      adolescent HFD. These results will help understanding the contribution of 
      microRNAs in the emergence of cognitive deficits following early-life 
      environmental events.

TI  - miRNome Expression Analysis Reveals New Players on Leprosy Immune 
      Physiopathology.

LID - 463
AB  - Leprosy remains as a public health problem and its physiopathology is still not 
      fully understood. MicroRNAs (miRNA) are small RNA non-coding that can interfere 
      with mRNA to regulate gene expression. A few studies using DNA chip microarrays 
      have explored the expression of miRNA in leprosy patients using a predetermined 
      set of genes as targets, providing interesting findings regarding the regulation 
      of immune genes. However, using a predetermined set of genes restricted the 
      possibility of finding new miRNAs that might be involved in different mechanisms 
      of disease. Thus, we examined the miRNome of tuberculoid (TT) and lepromatous 
      (LL) patients using both blood and lesional biopsies from classical leprosy 
      patients (LP) who visited the Dr. Marcello Candia Reference Unit in Sanitary 
      Dermatology in the State of Pará and compared them with healthy subjects. Using a 
      set of tools to correlate significantly differentially expressed miRNAs with 
      their gene targets, we identified possible interactions and networks of miRNAs 
      that might be involved in leprosy immunophysiopathology. Using this approach, we 
      showed that the leprosy miRNA profile in blood is distinct from that in lesional 
      skin as well as that four main groups of genes are the targets of leprosy miRNA: 
      (1) recognition and phagocytosis, with activation of immune effector cells, where 
      the immunosuppressant profile of LL and immunoresponsive profile of TT are 
      clearly affected by miRNA expression; (2) apoptosis, with supportive data for an 
      antiapoptotic leprosy profile based on BCL2, MCL1, and CASP8 expression; (3) 
      Schwann cells (SCs), demyelination and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), 
      supporting a role for different developmental or differentiation gene families, 
      such as Sox, Zeb, and Hox; and (4) loss of sensation and neuropathic pain, 
      revealing that RHOA, ROCK1, SIGMAR1, and aquaporin-1 (AQP1) may be involved in 
      the loss of sensation or leprosy pain, indicating possible new therapeutic 
      targets. Additionally, AQP1 may also be involved in skin dryness and loss of 
      elasticity, which are well known signs of leprosy but with unrecognized 
      physiopathology. In sum, miRNA expression reveals new aspects of leprosy 
      immunophysiopathology, especially on the regulation of the immune system, 
      apoptosis, SC demyelination, EMT, and neuropathic pain.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) affects one million people in the US. Ulcerative 
      colitis (UC) is a subtype of IBD that can lead to colitis-associated cancer 
      (CAC). In UC, the rate of CAC is 3-5-fold greater than the rate of sporadic 
      colorectal cancer (CRC). The pathogenesis of UC and CAC are due to aberrant 
      interactions between host immune system and microenvironment, but precise 
      mechanisms are still unknown. In colitis and CAC, microenvironmental fibroblasts 
      exhibit an activated, inflammatory phenotype that contributes to tumorigenesis 
      accompanied by excessive secretion of the chemokine CXCL8. However, mechanisms 
      regulating CXCL8 secretion are unclear. Since it is known that miRNAs regulate 
      chemokines such as CXCL8, we queried a microRNA library for mimics affecting 
      CXCL8 secretion. Among the identified microRNAs, miR-20a/b was further 
      investigated as its stromal expression levels inversely correlated with the 
      amounts of CXCL8 secreted and predicted fibroblast tumor-promoting activity. 
      Indeed, miR-20a directly bound to the 3'UTR of CXCL8 mRNA and regulated its 
      expression by translational repression. In vivo co-inoculation studies with CRC 
      stem cells demonstrated that fibroblasts characterized by high miR-20a expression 
      had reduced tumor-promoting activities. These studies reveal that in stromal 
      fibroblasts, miR-20a modulates CXCL8 function, therefore influencing tumor 
      latency.

AB  - Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia affecting the 
      elderly population worldwide. We have performed a comprehensive transcriptome 
      profiling of Late-Onset AD (LOAD) patients using second generation sequencing 
      technologies, identifying 2,064 genes, 47 lncRNAs and 4 miRNAs whose expression 
      is specifically deregulated in the hippocampal region of LOAD patients. Moreover, 
      analyzing the hippocampal, temporal and frontal regions from the same LOAD 
      patients, we identify specific sets of deregulated miRNAs for each region, and we 
      confirm that the miR-132/212 cluster is deregulated in each of these regions in 
      LOAD patients, consistent with these miRNAs playing a role in AD pathogenesis. 
      Notably, a luciferase assay indicates that miR-184 is able to target the 3'UTR 
      NR4A2 - which is known to be involved in cognitive functions and long-term memory 
      and whose expression levels are inversely correlated with those of miR-184 in the 
      hippocampus. Finally, RNA editing analysis  reveals a general RNA editing 
      decrease in LOAD hippocampus, with 14 recoding sites significantly and 
      differentially edited in 11 genes. Our data underline specific transcriptional 
      changes in LOAD brain and provide an important source of information for 
      understanding the molecular changes characterizing LOAD progression.

AB  - Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) is the primary cause of post-weaning 
      multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) and other PCV-associated diseases. 
      According to our previous RNA-sequencing analysis, the differences in the 
      susceptibility to PCV2 infection depended on the genetic differences between the 
      Laiwu (LW) and Yorkshire × Landrace crossbred (YL) pigs, but the cellular 
      microRNA (miRNA) that are differentially expressed between the LW and YL pigs 
      before and after PCV2 infection remain to be determined. In this study, 
      high-throughput sequencing was performed to determine the abundance and 
      differential expression of miRNA in lung tissues from PCV2-infected and 
      PCV2-uninfected LW and YL pigs. In total, 295 known and 95 novel miRNA were 
      identified, and 23 known and 25 novel miRNA were significantly differentially 
      expressed in the PCV2-infected vs. PCV2-uninfected LW pigs and/or the 
      PCV2-infected vs. PCV2-uninfected YL pigs. The expression levels of ssc-miR-122, 
      ssc-miR-192, ssc-miR-451, ssc-miR-486, and ssc-miR-504 were confirmed by 
      quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Analysis of the potential targets of the 
      four up-regulated miRNA (i.e., ssc-miR-122, ssc-miR-192, ssc-miR-451 and 
      ssc-miR-486) identified pathways and genes that may be important for disease 
      resistance. Among the up-regulated miRNA, ssc-miR-122 can repress the protein 
      expression and viral DNA replication of PCV2 and down-regulate the expression of 
      the nuclear factor of activated T-cells 5 (NFAT5) and aminopeptidase puromycin 
      sensitive (NPEPPS) by binding to their 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) in PK15 
      cells. Therefore, ssc-miR-122 may indirectly suppress PCV2 infection by targeting 
      genes related to the host immune system, such as NFAT5 and NPEPPS.

TI  - miR-518f-5p decreases tetraspanin CD9 protein levels and differentially affects 
      non-tumourigenic prostate and prostate cancer cell migration and adhesion.
PG  - 1980-1991
LID - 10.18632/oncotarget.23118 [doi]
AB  - Tetraspanin CD9 is generally considered to be a metastasis suppressor, with 
      decreased levels associated with progression and metastasis in many advanced 
      stage cancers. Little is known about the cause of CD9 dysregulation in prostate 
      cancer, however there are several miRNA-binding sites in the 3´UTR of the 
      transcript suggesting it could be post-transcriptionally regulated. Using 
      microarrays and luciferase assays in tumourigenic and non-tumourigenic prostate 
      cell lines we identified miR-518f-5p as a regulator of the CD9 3'UTR gene 
      expression, and decreased expression of endogenous CD9 in non-tumorigenic 
      prostate RWPE1 and prostate cancer DU145 cells. This resulted in differential 
      functional effects, in which RWPE1 cells showed increased migration and decreased 
      adhesion to extracellular matrix substrates, whereas DU145 cells showed decreased 
      migration and increased adhesion. Moreover, overexpression of miR-518f-5p 
      significantly increased proliferation between 48h and 72h in normal RWPE1 cells, 
      with no effect on tumourigenic DU145 cell proliferation. These results show that 
      tetraspanin CD9 is regulated by miRNAs in prostate cell lines and that due to 
      differential functional effects in non-tumourigenic versus tumourigenic prostate 
      cells, miR-518f-5p may be an effective biomarker and/or therapeutic target for 
      prostate cancer progression.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Circulating miRNAs (ci-miRNAs) are endogenous, non-coding RNAs 
      emerging as potential diagnostic biomarkers. Equine miRNAs have been previously 
      identified including subsets of tissue-specific miRNAs. In order to investigate 
      ci-miRNAs as diagnostic tools, normal patterns of expression for different 
      scenarios including responses to exercise need to be identified. Human studies 
      have demonstrated that many ci-miRNAs are up-regulated following exercise with 
      changes in expression patterns in skeletal muscle. However, technical challenges 
      such as haemolysis impact on accurate plasma ci-miRNA quantification, with 
      haemolysis often occurring naturally in horses following moderate-to-intense 
      exercise. The objectives of this study were to identify plasma ci-miRNA profiles 
      and skeletal muscle miRNAs before and after exercise in Thoroughbreds (Tb), and 
      to evaluate for the presence and effect of haemolysis on plasma ci-miRNA 
      determination. Resting and post-exercise plasma ci-miRNA profiles and haemolysis 
      were evaluated in twenty 3 year-old Tbs in sprint training. Resting and 
      post-exercise skeletal muscle miRNA abundance was evaluated in a second cohort of 
      eleven 2 year-old Tbs just entering sprint training. Haemolysis was further 
      quantified in resting blood samples from twelve Tbs in sprint training. A human 
      plasma panel containing 179 miRNAs was used for profiling, with haemolysis 
      assessed spectrophotometrically. Data was analysed using a paired Student's 
      t-test and Pearson's rank correlation. RESULTS: Plasma ci-miRNA data for 13/20 
      horses and all skeletal muscle miRNA data passed quality control. From plasma, 
      52/179 miRNAs were detected at both time-points. Haemolysis levels were greater 
      than the threshold for accurate quantification of ci-miRNAs in 18/25 resting and 
      all post-exercise plasma samples. Positive correlations (P < 0.05) between 
      haemolysis and miRNA abundance were detected for all but 4 miRNAs, so 
      exercise-induced changes in plasma ci-miRNA expression could not be quantified. 
      In skeletal muscle samples, 97/179 miRNAs were detected with 5 miRNAs (miR-21-5p, 
      let-7d-3p, let-7d-5p, miR-30b-5p, miR-30e-5p) differentially expressed (DE, 
      P < 0.05) between time-points. CONCLUSIONS: The degree of haemolysis needs to be 
      determined prior to quantifying plasma ci-miRNA expression from horses in 
      high-intensity exercise training. Identification of DE miRNAs in skeletal muscle 
      indicates modification of miRNA expression may contribute to adaptive training 
      responses in Tbs. Using a human plasma panel likely limited detection of 
      equine-specific miRNAs.

TI  - A 4-miRNA signature to predict survival in glioblastomas.
PG  - e0188090
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0188090 [doi]
LID - e0188090
AB  - Glioblastomas are among the most lethal cancers; however, recent advances in 
      survival have increased the need for better prognostic markers. microRNAs 
      (miRNAs) hold great prognostic potential being deregulated in glioblastomas and 
      highly stable in stored tissue specimens. Moreover, miRNAs control multiple genes 
      representing an additional level of gene regulation possibly more prognostically 
      powerful than a single gene. The aim of the study was to identify a novel miRNA 
      signature with the ability to separate patients into prognostic subgroups. 
      Samples from 40 glioblastoma patients were included retrospectively; patients 
      were comparable on all clinical aspects except overall survival enabling patients 
      to be categorized as short-term or long-term survivors based on median survival. 
      A miRNome screening was employed, and a prognostic profile was developed using 
      leave-one-out cross-validation. We found that expression patterns of miRNAs; 
      particularly the four miRNAs: hsa-miR-107_st, hsa-miR-548x_st, hsa-miR-3125_st 
      and hsa-miR-331-3p_st could determine short- and long-term survival with a 
      predicted accuracy of 78%. Heatmap dendrograms dichotomized glioblastomas into 
      prognostic subgroups with a significant association to survival in univariate (HR 
      8.50; 95% CI 3.06-23.62; p<0.001) and multivariate analysis (HR 9.84; 95% CI 
      2.93-33.06; p<0.001). Similar tendency was seen in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) 
      using a 2-miRNA signature of miR-107 and miR-331 (miR sum score), which were the 
      only miRNAs available in TCGA. In TCGA, patients with 
      O6-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) unmethylated tumors and low miR sum 
      score had the shortest survival. Adjusting for age and MGMT status, low miR sum 
      score was associated with a poorer prognosis (HR 0.66; 95% CI 0.45-0.97; p = 
      0.033). A Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis predicted the 
      identified miRNAs to regulate genes involved in cell cycle regulation and 
      survival. In conclusion, the biology of miRNAs is complex, but the identified 
      4-miRNA expression pattern could comprise promising biomarkers in glioblastoma 
      stratifying patients into short- and long-term survivors.

AB  - Changes in miRNA expression glomerular of capillaries during antibody-mediated 
      rejection (ABMR) are poorly understood and could contribute to the deleterious 
      inflammation and fibrosis of ABMR via suppression of target genes. A better 
      understanding could lead to novel diagnostic tools and reveal novel therapeutic 
      targets. We explored deregulated miRNAs in an glomeruloendothelial in vitro model 
      of ABMR due to class I human leukocyte antigen (HLA) with and without complement 
      activation. We studied a set of 16 promising candidate miRNAs in microdissected 
      glomeruli a confirmation set of 20 human transplant biopsies (DSA+) compared to 
      10 matched controls without evidence for ABMR. Twelve out of these 16 
      glomerulocapillary miRNAs could successfully be confirmed as dysregulated in vivo 
      with 10 upregulated (let-7c-5p, miR-28-3p, miR-30d-5p, miR-99b-5p, miR-125a-5p, 
      miR-195-5p, miR-374b-3p, miR-484, miR-501-3p, miR-520e) and 2 downregulated 
      (miR29b-3p, miR-885-5p) in DSA+ vs. CONTROLS: A random forest analysis based on 
      glomerular miRNAs identified 18/20 DSA+ and 8/10 controls correctly. This 
      glomerulocapillary miRNA signature associated with HLA class I-DSA could improve 
      our understanding of ABMR and be useful for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes.

AB  - Previous reports have suggested the significant association of miRNAs aberrant 
      expression with tumor initiation, progression and metastasis in cancer, including 
      gastrointestinal (GI) cancers. The current preliminary study aimed to evaluate 
      the relative expression levels of miR-196a2 and three of its selected 
      apoptosis-related targets; ANXA1, DFFA and PDCD4 in a sample of GI cancer 
      patients. Quantitative real-time PCR for miR-196a2 and its selected mRNA targets, 
      as well as immunohistochemical assay for annexin A1 protein expression were 
      detected in 58 tissues with different GI cancer samples. In addition, correlation 
      with the clinicopathological features and in silico network analysis of the 
      selected molecular markers were analyzed. Stratified analyses by cancer site 
      revealed elevated levels of miR-196a2 and low expression of the selected target 
      genes. Annexin protein expression was positively correlated with its gene 
      expression profile. In colorectal cancer, miR-196a over-expression was negatively 
      correlated with annexin A1 protein expression (r = -0.738, p < 0.001), and both 
      were indicators of unfavorable prognosis in terms of poor differentiation, larger 
      tumor size, and advanced clinical stage. Taken together, aberrant expression of 
      miR-196a2 and the selected apoptosis-related biomarkers might be involved in GI 
      cancer development and progression and could have potential diagnostic and 
      prognostic roles in these types of cancer; particularly colorectal cancer, 
      provided the results experimentally validated and confirmed in larger 
      multi-center studies.

TI  - miR-34c-5p and CaMKII are involved in aldosterone-induced fibrosis in kidney 
      collecting duct cells.
PG  - F329-F342
LID - 10.1152/ajprenal.00358.2017 [doi]
AB  - Mineralocorticoids trigger a profibrotic process in the kidney. In mouse cortical 
      collecting duct cells, the present study addressed two main questions: 1) what 
      are microRNAs (miRNAs) and their target genes that are changed by aldosterone? 
      and 2) what do miRNAs, in response to aldosterone, regulate regarding signaling 
      pathways related to fibrosis? A microarray chip assay was done in cells in the 
      absence or presence of aldosterone treatment (10(-6) M; 3 days). The candidate 
      miRNAs were identified by the criteria of >30% of fold change among the 
      significantly changed miRNAs ( P < 0.05). Twenty-nine miRNAs were upregulated 
      (>1.3-fold), and 27 miRNAs were downregulated (<0.7-fold). Putative target genes 
      of identified miRNAs were associated with 74 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and 
      Genomes pathways. Among them, the wingless-related integration site (Wnt) 
      signaling pathway was highly ranked, where 15 mature miRNAs were observed. These 
      miRNAs were further analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR, and among them, 
      miR-130b-3p, miR-34c-5p, and miR-146a-5p were selected. Through the 
      identification of putative target genes of these three miRNAs, mRNA and protein 
      expression of the Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type II β-chain ( 
      Camk2b) gene (a target gene of miR-34c-5p) were found to be increased 
      significantly in aldosterone-treated cells, where fibronectin (FN) and α-smooth 
      muscle actin were induced. When CaMKIIβ small interfering RNA or the miR-34c-5p 
      mimic was transfected, aldosterone-induced FN expression was significantly 
      attenuated, along with reduced CaMKIIβ protein expression. A luciferase reporter 
      assay revealed a decrease of CaMKIIβ translation in cells transfected with miRNA 
      mimics of miR-34c-5p. In conclusion, aldosterone-induced downregulation of 
      miR-34c-5p in the Wnt signaling pathway and a consequent increase of CaMKIIβ 
      expression are likely to be involved in aldosterone-induced fibrosis.

TI  - Molecular analysis of high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma with and without

AB  - Many high-grade serous carcinomas (HGSCs) of the pelvis are thought to originate 
      in the distal portion of the fallopian tube. Serous tubal intra-epithelial 
      carcinoma (STIC) lesions are the putative precursor to HGSC and identifiable in 
      ~ 50% of advanced stage cases. To better understand the molecular etiology of 
      HGSCs, we report a multi-center integrated genomic analysis of advanced stage 
      tumors with and without STIC lesions and normal tissues. The most significant 
      focal DNA SCNAs were shared between cases with and without STIC lesions. The RNA 
      sequence and the miRNA data did not identify any clear separation between cases 
      with and without STIC lesions. HGSCs had molecular profiles more similar to 
      normal fallopian tube epithelium than ovarian surface epithelium or peritoneum. 
      The data suggest that the molecular features of HGSCs with and without associated 
      STIC lesions are mostly shared, indicating a common biologic origin, likely to be 
      the distal fallopian tube among all cases.High-grade serous carcinomas (HGSCs) 
      are associated with precursor lesions (STICs) in the fallopian epithelium in only 
      half of the cases. Here the authors report the molecular analysis of HGSCs with 
      and without associated STICs and show similar profiles supporting a common origin 
      for all HGSCs.

TI  - Deregulation of miR-34a and Its Chaperon Hsp70 in Hepatitis C virus-Induced Liver 
      Cirrhosis and Hepatocellular Carcinoma Patients.
PG  - 2395-2401
AB  - Background: MicroRNA deregulation may occur during hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 
      genesis and progression stages. MicroRNA-34a (miR-34a) functions as a tumor 
      suppressor and is down-regulated or silenced in a variety of human cancers, while 
      heat shock proteins (Hsps) play important roles in assisting protein folding and 
      preventing both protein aggregation and transport across membranes. The present 
      study aimed to evaluating serum expression of miR-34a and its target Hsp70 for 
      early detection of HCC in patients with liver cirrhosis (LC), focusing on 
      correlations with clinicopathological features. Methods: A total of 180 patients 
      were included: 120 with HCC on top of LC (60 with either early or late HCC) and 
      60 patients with HCV-related LC. In addition, 60 healthy individuals were 
      considered as controls. Real-time polymerase chain reactions were performed for 
      expression profiling of serum miR-34a and Hsp70 and for allelic discrimination of 
      the promotor variant (rs2763979, C/T). In addition, in silico analysis was 
      carried out. Results: All participants were heterozygote for the promotor 
      polymorphism. miR-34a serum levels were significantly under-expressed in LC and 
      especially HCC patients as compared to controls. Associations with a high 
      Child-Turcotte- Pugh (CTP) score, advanced cancer stage, and number of masses 
      were noted. In contrast the target Hsp70 was significantly overexpressed in 
      cancer patients but not in LC group and inversely correlated with miR-34a levels. 
      Conclusion: Utility of circulating miRNAs as biomarkers for early detection of 
      HCC was raised. Future large-scale studies are warranted to confirm the current 
      findings.

AB  - We have previously shown that rat allogeneic DC, made immature by adenoviral gene 
      transfer of the dominant negative form of IKK2, gave rise in-vitro to a unique 
      population of CD4(+)CD25(-) regulatory T cells (dnIKK2-Treg). These cells 
      inhibited Tcell response in-vitro, without needing cell-to-cell contact, and 
      induced kidney allograft survival prolongation in-vivo. Deep insight into the 
      mechanisms behind dnIKK2-Treg-induced suppression of Tcell proliferation remained 
      elusive. Here we document that dnIKK2-Treg release extracellular vesicles (EV) 
      riched in exosomes, fully accounting for the cell-contact independent 
      immunosuppressive activity of parent cells. DnIKK2-Treg-EV contain a unique 
      molecular cargo of specific miRNAs and iNOS, which, once delivered into target 
      cells, blocked cell cycle progression and induced apoptosis. 
      DnIKK2-Treg-EV-exposed T cells were in turn converted into regulatory cells. 
      Notably, when administered in-vivo, dnIKK2-Treg-EV prolonged kidney allograft 
      survival. DnIKK2-Treg-derived EV could be a tool for manipulating the immune 
      system and for discovering novel potential immunosuppressive molecules in the 
      context of allotransplantation.

TI  - Combinatorial ensemble miRNA target prediction of co-regulation networks with 
      non-prediction data.

LID - 10.1093/nar/gkx605 [doi]
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are key regulators of cell-fate decisions in development and 
      disease with a vast array of target interactions that can be investigated using 
      computational approaches. For this study, we developed metaMIR, a combinatorial 
      approach to identify miRNAs that co-regulate identified subsets of genes from a 
      user-supplied list. We based metaMIR predictions on an improved dataset of human 
      miRNA-target interactions, compiled using a machine-learning-based meta-analysis 
      of established algorithms. Simultaneously, the inverse dataset of negative 
      interactions not likely to occur was extracted to increase classifier 
      performance, as measured using an expansive set of experimentally validated 
      interactions from a variety of sources. In a second differential mode, candidate 
      miRNAs are predicted by indicating genes to be targeted and others to be avoided 
      to potentially increase specificity of results. As an example, we investigate the 
      neural crest, a transient structure in vertebrate development where miRNAs play a 
      pivotal role. Patterns of metaMIR-predicted miRNA regulation alone partially 
      recapitulated functional relationships among genes, and separate differential 
      analysis revealed miRNA candidates that would downregulate components implicated 
      in cancer progression while not targeting tumour suppressors. Such an approach 
      could aid in therapeutic application of miRNAs to reduce unintended effects. The 
      utility is available at http://rna.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/metaMIR/.

TI  - miR-199a-3p and miR-214-3p improve the overall survival prediction of 
      muscle-invasive bladder cancer patients after radical cystectomy.
PG  - 2252-2262
LID - 10.1002/cam4.1161 [doi]
AB  - To improve the clinical decision-making regarding further treatment management 
      and follow-up scheduling for patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) 
      after radical cystectomy (RC), a better prediction accuracy of prognosis for 
      these patients is urgently needed. The objective of this study was to evaluate 
      the validity of differentially expressed microRNAs (miRNAs) based on a previous 
      study as prognostic markers for overall survival (OS) after RC in models combined 
      with clinicopathological data. The expression of six miRNAs (miR-100-5p, 
      miR-130b-3p, miR-141-3p, miR-199a-3p, miR-205-5p, and miR-214-3p) was measured by 
      RT-qPCR in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples from 156 MIBC 
      patients who received RC in three urological centers. Samples from 2000 to 2013 
      were used according to their tissue availability, with follow-up until June 2016. 
      The patient cohort was randomly divided into a training (n = 100) and test set 
      (n = 56). Seventy-three samples from adjacent normal tissue were used as 
      controls. Kaplan-Meier, univariate and multivariate Cox regression, and decision 
      curve analyses were carried out to assess the association of clinicopathological 
      variables and miRNAs to OS. Both increased (miR-130b-3p and miR-141-3p) and 
      reduced (miR-100-5p, miR-199a-3p, and miR-214-3p) miRNA expressions were found in 
      MIBC samples in comparison to nonmalignant tissue samples (P < 0.0001). 
      miR-199a-3p and miR-214-3p were independent markers of OS in Cox regression 
      models with the significant clinicopathological variables age, tumor status, and 
      lymph node status. The prediction model with the clinicopathological variables 
      was improved by these two miRNAs in both sets. The predictive benefit was 
      confirmed by decision curve analysis. In conclusion, the inclusion of both miRNAs 
      into models based on clinical data for the outcome prediction of MIBC patients 
      after RC could be a valuable approach to improve prognostic accuracy.

TI  - Massive transcriptome sequencing of human spinal cord tissues provides new 
      insights into motor neuron degeneration in ALS.
PG  - 10046
LID - 10.1038/s41598-017-10488-7 [doi]
LID - 10046
AB  - ALS is a devastating and debilitating human disease characterized by the 
      progressive death of upper and lower motor neurons. Although much effort has been 
      made to elucidate molecular determinants underlying the onset and progression of 
      the disorder, the causes of ALS remain largely unknown. In the present work, we 
      have deeply sequenced whole transcriptome from spinal cord ventral horns of 
      post-mortem ALS human donors affected by the sporadic form of the disease (which 
      comprises ~90% of the cases but which is less investigated than the inherited 
      form of the disease). We observe 1160 deregulated genes including 18 miRNAs and 
      show that down regulated genes are mainly of neuronal derivation while up 
      regulated genes have glial origin and tend to be involved in neuroinflammation or 
      cell death. Remarkably, we find strong deregulation of SNAP25 and STX1B at both 
      mRNA and protein levels suggesting impaired synaptic function through SNAP25 
      reduction as a possible cause of calcium elevation and glutamate excitotoxicity. 
      We also note aberrant alternative splicing but not disrupted RNA editing.

TI  - UPF1 helicase promotes TSN-mediated miRNA decay.
PG  - 1483-1493
LID - 10.1101/gad.303537.117 [doi]
AB  - While microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate the vast majority of protein-encoding 
      transcripts, little is known about how miRNAs themselves are degraded. We 
      recently described Tudor-staphylococcal/micrococcal-like nuclease (TSN)-mediated 
      miRNA decay (TumiD) as a cellular pathway in which the nuclease TSN promotes the 
      decay of miRNAs that contain CA and/or UA dinucleotides. While TSN-mediated 
      degradation of either protein-free or AGO2-loaded miRNAs does not require the 
      ATP-dependent RNA helicase UPF1 in vitro, we report here that cellular TumiD 
      requires UPF1. Results from experiments using AGO2-loaded miRNAs in duplex with 
      target mRNAs indicate that UPF1 can dissociate miRNAs from their mRNA targets, 
      making the miRNAs susceptible to TumiD. miR-seq (deep sequencing of miRNAs) data 
      reveal that the degradation of ∼50% of candidate TumiD targets in T24 human 
      urinary bladder cancer cells is augmented by UPF1. We illustrate the 
      physiological relevance by demonstrating that UPF1-augmented TumiD promotes the 
      invasion of T24 cells in part by degrading anti-invasive miRNAs so as to 
      up-regulate the expression of proinvasive proteins.

TI  - Regulation of Smad mediated microRNA transcriptional response in ground squirrels 
      during hibernation.
PG  - 151-161
LID - 10.1007/s11010-017-3144-4 [doi]
AB  - Mammalian hibernation is a state of dormancy that is used by some animals to 
      survive through the unfavorable conditions of winter, and is characterized by 
      coordinated suppression of basal metabolism that is supported by global 
      inhibition of energy/ATP-consuming processes. In this study, we examine the 
      regulation of the anti-proliferatory TGF-β/Smad transcription factor signaling 
      pathway in the liver tissue of the hibernating 13-lined ground squirrel Ictidomys 
      tridecemlineatus. The TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway is known to mediate cell cycle 
      arrest through induction of cell cycle dependent kinase inhibitors, and more 
      recently, has been shown to regulate a wide range of cellular processes via its 
      control of microRNA biosynthesis. We show that phosphorylation levels of the 
      Smad3 protein at its activation residue is increased by ~1.5-fold during torpor, 
      and this is associated with an increase in nuclear localization and DNA binding 
      activity of Smad3. Expression levels of several TGF-β induced microRNAs 
      previously described in human cells were also activated in ground squirrel during 
      torpor. Among these were miR-21, miR-23a, and miR-107, which contain either the 
      conserved R-SBE or R-SBE related motif found in microRNAs that are 
      post-transcriptionally processed by Smad proteins. We show that levels of miR-21 
      were highly elevated at multiple stages of torpor, and predicted gene targets of 
      miR-21 were enriched to multiple pro-growth cellular processes. Overall, we 
      provide evidence that show the Smad3 transcription factor is activated in ground 
      squirrels during torpor, and suggest a role for this signaling pathway in 
      mediating anti-proliferatory signals via its transcriptional control of cell 
      cycle inhibitors and downstream microRNAs.

TI  - Dysregulation of a novel miR-23b/27b-p53 axis impairs muscle stem cell 
      differentiation of humans with type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 770-779
LID - 10.1016/j.molmet.2017.04.006 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are increasingly recognized as fine-tuning 
      regulators of metabolism, and are dysregulated in several disease conditions. 
      With their capacity to rapidly change gene expression, miRNAs are also important 
      regulators of development and cell differentiation. In the current study, we 
      describe an impaired myogenic capacity of muscle stem cells isolated from humans 
      with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and assess whether this phenotype is regulated by 
      miRNAs. METHODS: We measured global miRNA expression during in vitro 
      differentiation of muscle stem cells derived from T2DM patients and healthy 
      controls. RESULTS: The mir-23b/27b cluster was downregulated in the cells of the 
      patients, and a pro-myogenic effect of these miRNAs was mediated through the p53 
      pathway, which was concordantly dysregulated in the muscle cells derived from 
      humans with T2DM. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that we have identified a 
      novel pathway for coordination of myogenesis, the miR-23b/27b-p53 axis that, when 
      dysregulated, potentially contributes to a sustained muscular dysfunction in 
      T2DM.

TI  - Endurance Exercise Ability in the Horse: A Trait with Complex Polygenic 
      Determinism.
PG  - 89
LID - 10.3389/fgene.2017.00089 [doi]
LID - 89
AB  - Endurance horses are able to run at more than 20 km/h for 160 km (in bouts of 
      30-40 km). This level of performance is based on intense aerobic metabolism, 
      effective body heat dissipation and the ability to endure painful exercise. The 
      known heritabilities of endurance performance and exercise-related physiological 
      traits in Arabian horses suggest that adaptation to extreme endurance exercise is 
      influenced by genetic factors. The objective of the present genome-wide 
      association study (GWAS) was to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) 
      related to endurance racing performance in 597 Arabian horses. The performance 
      traits studied were the total race distance, average race speed and finishing 
      status (qualified, eliminated or retired). We used three mixed models that 
      included a fixed allele or genotype effect and a random, polygenic effect. 
      Quantile-quantile plots were acceptable, and the regression coefficients for 
      actual vs. expected log(10)p-values ranged from 0.865 to 1.055. The GWAS revealed 
      five significant quantitative trait loci (QTL) corresponding to 6 SNPs on 
      chromosomes 6, 1, 7, 16, and 29 (two SNPs) with corrected p-values from 1.7 × 
      10(-6) to 1.8 × 10(-5). Annotation of these 5 QTL revealed two genes: 
      sortilin-related VPS10-domain-containing receptor 3 (SORCS3) on chromosome 1 is 
      involved in protein trafficking, and solute carrier family 39 member 12 
      (SLC39A12) on chromosome 29 is active in zinc transport and cell homeostasis. 
      These two coding genes could be involved in neuronal tissues (CNS). The other QTL 
      on chromosomes 6, 7, and 16 may be involved in the regulation of the gene 
      expression through non-coding RNAs, CpG islands and transcription factor binding 
      sites. On chromosome 6, a new candidate equine long non-coding RNA (KCNQ1OT1 
      ortholog: opposite antisense transcript 1 of potassium voltage-gated channel 
      subfamily Q member 1 gene) was predicted in silico and validated by RT-qPCR in 
      primary cultures of equine myoblasts and fibroblasts. This lncRNA could be one 
      element of the cardiac rhythm regulation. Our GWAS revealed that equine 
      performance during endurance races is a complex polygenic trait, and is partially 
      governed by at least 5 QTL: two coding genes involved in neuronal tissues and 
      three other loci with many regulatory functions such as slowing down heart rate.

TI  - Supplementation with small-extracellular vesicles from ovarian follicular fluid 
      during in vitro production modulates bovine embryo development.

AB  - Pregnancy success results from the interaction of multiple factors, among them 
      are folliculogenesis and early embryonic development. Failure during these 
      different processes can lead to difficulties in conception. Alternatives to 
      overcome these problems are based on assisted reproductive techniques. 
      Extracellular vesicles are cell-secreted vesicles present in different body 
      fluids and contain bioactive materials, such as messenger RNA, microRNAs 
      (miRNAs), and proteins. Thus, our hypothesis is that extracellular vesicles from 
      follicular fluid from 3-6 mm ovarian follicles can modulate bovine embryo 
      development in vitro. To test our hypothesis follicular fluid from bovine ovaries 
      was aspirated and small-extracellular vesicles (<200 nm) were isolated for 
      further analysis. Additionally, small-extracellular vesicles (EVs) were utilized 
      for functional experiments investigating their role in modulating messenger RNA, 
      microRNA as well as global DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation levels of 
      bovine blastocysts. EVs from 3-6 mm follicles were used for RNA-seq and miRNA 
      analysis. Functional annotation analysis of the EVs transcripts revealed messages 
      related to chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. EVs treatment 
      during oocyte maturation and embryo development causes changes in blastocyst 
      rates, as well as changes in the transcription levels of genes related to 
      embryonic metabolism and development. Supplementation with EVs from 3-6 mm 
      follicles during oocyte maturation and early embryo development (until the 4-cell 
      stage) increased the levels of bta-miR-631 (enriched in EVs from 3-6 mm 
      follicles) in embryos. Interestingly, the addition of EVs from 3-6 mm follicles 
      induced changes in global DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation levels compared 
      to embryos produced by the standard in vitro production system. Our results 
      indicate that the supplementation of culture media with EVs isolated from the 
      follicular fluid of 3-6 mm follicles during oocyte maturation and early embryo 
      development can partially modify metabolic and developmental related genes as 
      well as miRNA and global DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation, suggesting that 
      EVs play an important role during oocyte maturation and early embryo development 
      in vitro.

TI  - Expression of Salivary miR-203a-3p Was Related with Oral Health-Related Quality 
      of Life in Healthy Volunteers.
LID - 10.3390/ijms18061263 [doi]
LID - 1263
AB  - Oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) is a multidimensional construct that 
      involves subjective evaluation of an individual's oral health. Although it is 
      difficult to evaluate OHRQoL biologically, recently, it has been reported that 
      circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) in several body fluids could reflect various 
      health conditions. The aim of this pilot study was to investigate whether 
      salivary miRNAs expression differs according to OHRQoL in healthy volunteers. 
      Forty-six volunteers (median age, 23.0 years) were recruited, and their OHRQoL 
      was assessed using the Japanese version of the Oral Health Impact Profile 
      (OHIP-J). Then, we compared salivary microRNA profiles of the high-OHRQoL group 
      (≤25th percentile score of OHIP-J) and the low-OHRQoL group (≥75th percentile 
      score of OHIP-J) using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) array and the 
      quantitative real-time PCR. There were no significant differences between the two 
      groups in terms of oral health status. In the PCR array, miR-203a-3p and 
      miR-30b-5p were significantly more expressed in the low-OHRQoL group (p < 0.05). 
      Quantitative real-time PCR assay also showed that miR-203a-3p was more highly 
      expressed in the low-OHRQoL group than in the high-OHRQoL group (p < 0.05). These 
      observations suggest that expression of salivary miR-203a-3p was related with 
      OHRQoL in healthy volunteers.

AB  - Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is an aggressive human cancer and miRNAs can 
      play a key role for this disease. In order to broaden the knowledge in this 
      field, the miRNA expression was investigated in a large series of MPM to discover 
      new pathways helpful in diagnosis, prognosis and therapy. We employed nanoString 
      nCounter system for miRNA profiling on 105 MPM samples and 10 healthy pleura. The 
      analysis was followed by the validation of the most significantly deregulated 
      miRNAs by RT-qPCR in an independent sample set. We identified 63 miRNAs 
      deregulated in a statistically significant way. MiR-185, miR-197, and miR-299 
      were confirmed differentially expressed, after validation study. In addition, the 
      results of the microarray analysis corroborated previous findings concerning 
      miR-15b-5p, miR-126-3p, and miR-145-5p. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to explore 
      the association between miRNA expression and overall survival (OS) and identified 
      a 2-miRNA prognostic signature (Let-7c-5p and miR-151a-5p) related to hypoxia and 
      energy metabolism respectively. In silico analyses with DIANA-microT-CDS 
      highlighted 5 putative targets in common between two miRNAs. With the present 
      work we showed that the pattern of miRNAs expression is highly deregulated in MPM 
      and that a 2-miRNA signature can be a new useful tool for prognosis in MPM.

      substantially higher amount of current knowledge in the field of radiobiology 
      comes from in vitro studies based on the cellular response to single dose (SD) 
      irradiation. In addition, intrinsic and acquired resistance to IR remains an 
      issue in clinical practice, leading to radiotherapy treatment failure. Numerous 
      previous studies suggest that an improved understanding of the molecular 
      processes involved in the radiation-induced DNA damage response to FD irradiation 
      could improve the effectiveness of radiotherapy. Therefore, the present study 
      examined the differential expression of genes and microRNA (miRNA) in murine 
      Lewis lung cancer (LLC)1 cells exposed to SD or FD irradiation. The results of 
      the present study indicated that the gene and miRNA expression profiles of LLC1 
      cells exposed to irradiation were dose delivery type-dependent. Data analysis 
      also revealed that mRNAs may be regulated by miRNAs in a radiation-dependent 
      manner, suggesting that these mRNAs and miRNAs are the potential targets in the 
      cellular response to SD or FD irradiation. However, LLC1 tumors after FD 
      irradiation exhibited no significant changes in the expression of selected genes 
      and miRNAs observed in the irradiated cells in vitro, suggesting that 
      experimental in vitro conditions, particularly the tumor microenvironment, should 
      be considered in detail to promote the development of efficient radiotherapy 
      approaches. Nevertheless, the present study highlights the primary signaling 
      pathways involved in the response of murine cancer cells to irradiation. Data 
      presented in the present study can be applied to improve the outcome and 
      development of radiotherapy in preclinical animal model settings.

AB  - MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that play crucial roles in the regulation of 
      gene expression and protein synthesis during brain development. MiR-3099 is 
      highly expressed throughout embryogenesis, especially in the developing central 
      nervous system. Moreover, miR-3099 is also expressed at a higher level in 
      differentiating neurons in vitro, suggesting that it is a potential regulator 
      during neuronal cell development. This study aimed to predict the target genes of 
      miR-3099 via in-silico analysis using four independent prediction algorithms 
      (miRDB, miRanda, TargetScan, and DIANA-micro-T-CDS) with emphasis on target genes 
      related to brain development and function. Based on the analysis, a total of 
      3,174 miR-3099 target genes were predicted. Those predicted by at least three 
      algorithms (324 genes) were subjected to DAVID bioinformatics analysis to 
      understand their overall functional themes and representation. The analysis 
      revealed that nearly 70% of the target genes were expressed in the nervous system 
      and a significant proportion were associated with transcriptional regulation and 
      protein ubiquitination mechanisms. Comparison of in situ hybridization (ISH) 
      expression patterns of miR-3099 in both published and in-house-generated ISH 
      sections with the ISH sections of target genes from the Allen Brain Atlas 
      identified 7 target genes (Dnmt3a, Gabpa, Gfap, Itga4, Lxn, Smad7, and Tbx18) 
      having expression patterns complementary to miR-3099 in the developing and adult 
      mouse brain samples. Of these, we validated Gfap as a direct downstream target of 
      miR-3099 using the luciferase reporter gene system. In conclusion, we report the 
      successful prediction and validation of Gfap as an miR-3099 target gene using a 
      combination of bioinformatics resources with enrichment of annotations based on 
      functional ontologies and a spatio-temporal expression dataset.

AB  - The aim of this study was to identify potential microRNAs and genes associated 
      with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) through web-available microarrays. The 
      microRNA microarray dataset GSE32538 and the mRNA datasets GSE32537, GSE53845, 
      and GSE10667 were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. 
      Differentially expressed miRNAs (DE-miRNAs)/genes (DEGs) were screened with 
      GEO2R, and their associations with IPF were analyzed by comprehensive 
      bioinformatic analyses. A total of 45 DE-microRNAs were identified between IPF 
      and control tissues, whereas 67 common DEGs were determined to exhibit the same 
      expression trends in all three microarrays. Furthermore, functional analysis 
      indicated that microRNAs in cancer and ECM-receptor interaction were the most 
      significant pathways and were enriched by the 45 DE-miRNAs and 67 common DEGs. 
      Finally, we predicted potential microRNA-target interactions between 17 DE-miRNAs 
      and 17 DEGs by using at least three online programs. A microRNA-mediated 
      regulatory network among the DE-miRNAs and DEGs was constructed that might shed 
      new light on potential biomarkers for the prediction of IPF progression.

TI  - Dynamic changes in murine forebrain miR-211 expression associate with cholinergic 
      imbalances and epileptiform activity.
PG  - E4996-E5005
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1701201114 [doi]
AB  - Epilepsy is a common neurological disease, manifested in unprovoked recurrent 
      seizures. Epileptogenesis may develop due to genetic or pharmacological origins 
      or following injury, but it remains unclear how the unaffected brain escapes this 
      susceptibility to seizures. Here, we report that dynamic changes in forebrain 
      microRNA (miR)-211 in the mouse brain shift the threshold for spontaneous and 
      pharmacologically induced seizures alongside changes in the cholinergic pathway 
      genes, implicating this miR in the avoidance of seizures. We identified miR-211 
      as a putative attenuator of cholinergic-mediated seizures by intersecting 
      forebrain miR profiles that were Argonaute precipitated, synaptic vesicle target 
      enriched, or differentially expressed under pilocarpine-induced seizures, and 
      validated TGFBR2 and the nicotinic antiinflammatory acetylcholine receptor 
      nAChRa7 as murine and human miR-211 targets, respectively. To explore the link 
      between miR-211 and epilepsy, we engineered dTg-211 mice with 
      doxycycline-suppressible forebrain overexpression of miR-211. These mice reacted 
      to doxycycline exposure by spontaneous electrocorticography-documented 
      nonconvulsive seizures, accompanied by forebrain accumulation of the convulsive 
      seizures mediating miR-134. RNA sequencing demonstrated in doxycycline-treated 
      dTg-211 cortices overrepresentation of synaptic activity, Ca(2+) transmembrane 
      transport, TGFBR2 signaling, and cholinergic synapse pathways. Additionally, a 
      cholinergic dysregulated mouse model overexpressing a miR refractory 
      acetylcholinesterase-R splice variant showed a parallel propensity for 
      convulsions, miR-211 decreases, and miR-134 elevation. Our findings demonstrate 
      that in mice, dynamic miR-211 decreases induce hypersynchronization and 
      nonconvulsive and convulsive seizures, accompanied by expression changes in 
      cholinergic and TGFBR2 pathways as well as in miR-134. Realizing the importance 
      of miR-211 dynamics opens new venues for translational diagnosis of and 
      interference with epilepsy.

AB  - Invasion is a hallmark of advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). 
      We previously determined that low relative miR-375 expression was associated with 
      poor patient prognosis. HNSCC cells with increased miR-375 expression have lower 
      invasive properties and impaired invadopodium activity. Using stable isotope 
      labeling with amino acids in cell culture and reverse-phase liquid chromatography 
      mass spectrometry, we assessed the impact of miR-375 expression on protein levels 
      in UM-SCC-1 cells. Increased miR-375 expression was associated with 
      down-regulation of proteins involved in cellular assembly and organization, death 
      and survival, and movement. Two invasion-associated proteins, vimentin and 
      L-plastin, were strongly down-regulated by miR-375. Luciferase reporter assays 
      demonstrated that high miR-375 expression reduced vimentin promoter activity, 
      suggesting that vimentin is an indirect target of miR-375. Runt-related 
      transcription factor 1 (RUNX1) is a potential miR-375 direct target, and its 
      knockdown reduced vimentin and L-plastin expression. Data in The Cancer Genome 
      Atlas HNSCC database showed a significant inverse correlation between miR-375 
      expression and RUNX1, vimentin, and L-plastin RNA expression. These clinical 
      correlations validate our in vitro model findings and support a mechanism in 
      which miR-375 suppresses RUNX1 levels, resulting in reduced vimentin and 
      L-plastin expression. Furthermore, knockdown of RUNX1, L-plastin, and vimentin 
      resulted in significant reductions in cell invasion in vitro, indicating the 
      functional significance of miR-375 regulation of specific proteins involved in 
      HNSCC invasion.

AB  - Altered microRNA (miRNA, miR) expression has been related to many disease 
      processes; however, the miRNA expression signature in calcific aortic valve 
      disease (CAVD) is unclear. In this study, microarrays were used to determine the 
      miRNA expression signature of tissue samples from healthy individuals (n = 4) and 
      patients with CAVD (n = 4). TargetScan, PITA, and microRNAorg 3-way databases 
      were used to predict the potential target genes. DIANA-miRPath was used to 
      incorporate the aberrant miRNAs into gene pathways. miRNA microarrays identified 
      92 differentially expressed miRNAs in CAVD tissues. The principal component 
      analysis (PCA) of these samples and the unsupervised hierarchical clustering 
      analysis based on the 92 aberrantly expressed miRNAs noted that miRNA expression 
      could be categorized into two well-defined clusters that corresponded to healthy 
      control and CAVD. Bioinformatic analysis showed the miRNA targets and potential 
      molecular pathways. Collectively, our study reported the miRNA expression 
      signature in CAVD and may provide potential therapeutic targets for CAVD.

TI  - Genome-Wide Analyses of MicroRNA Profiling in Interleukin-27 Treated 
      Monocyte-Derived Human Dendritic Cells Using Deep Sequencing: A Pilot Study.
LID - 10.3390/ijms18050925 [doi]
LID - 925
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression and thereby influence cell fate and 
      function. Recent studies suggest that an abundant class of miRNAs play important 
      roles in immune cells, such as T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, B cells, and 
      dendritic cells (DCs). Interleukin (IL)-27 is a member of the IL-12 family of 
      cytokines with broad anti-viral effects. It is a potent inhibitor of HIV-1 
      infection in CD4+ T cells and macrophages, as well as monocyte-derived immature 
      dendritic cells (iDCs). This pilot study compared miRNA profiles between iDCs and 
      IL-27-treated iDCs (27DCs) using deep sequencing methods and identified 46 known 
      miRNAs that were significantly differentially expressed in 27DCs: 36 were 
      upregulated and 10 downregulated by IL-27. Many of the potential target genes of 
      these miRNAs are involved in IL-27 associated pathways, such as JAK/STAT, MAPKs, 
      and PI3K and several were also previously reported to be involved in the 
      regulation of human DC function. This study found that these miRNAs also 
      potentially target several viral genomes and therefore may have antiviral 
      effects. Four of these differential miRNAs (miR-99a-5p, miR-222-3p, miR-138-5p, 
      and miR-125b-5p) were validated using quantitative reverse transcription PCR 
      (RT-qPCR). Twenty-two novel miRNAs were discovered from deep sequencing and 
      confirmed using RT-qPCR. This study furthers the understanding of the role of 
      IL-27 in immunity and lays a foundation for future characterization of the role 
      of specific miRNAs in DCs.

TI  - Host Genetic Background Strongly Affects Pulmonary microRNA Expression before and 
      during Influenza A Virus Infection.
PG  - 246

LID - 246
AB  - BACKGROUND: Expression of host microRNAs (miRNAs) changes markedly during 
      influenza A virus (IAV) infection of natural and adaptive hosts, but their role 
      in genetically determined host susceptibility to IAV infection has not been 
      explored. We, therefore, compared pulmonary miRNA expression during IAV infection 
      in two inbred mouse strains with differential susceptibility to IAV infection. 
      RESULTS: miRNA expression profiles were determined in lungs of the more 
      susceptible strain DBA/2J and the less susceptible strain C57BL/6J within 120 h 
      post infection (hpi) with IAV (H1N1) PR8. Even the miRNomes of uninfected lungs 
      differed substantially between the two strains. After a period of relative 
      quiescence, major miRNome reprogramming was detected in both strains by 48 hpi 
      and increased through 120 hpi. Distinct groups of miRNAs regulated by IAV 
      infection could be defined: (1) miRNAs (n = 39) whose expression correlated with 
      hemagglutinin (HA) mRNA expression and represented the general response to IAV 
      infection independent of host genetic background; (2) miRNAs (n = 20) whose 
      expression correlated with HA mRNA expression but differed between the two 
      strains; and (3) remarkably, miR-147-3p, miR-208b-3p, miR-3096a-5p, miR-3069b-3p, 
      and the miR-467 family, whose abundance even in uninfected lungs differentiated 
      nearly perfectly (area under the ROC curve > 0.99) between the two strains 
      throughout the time course, suggesting a particularly strong association with the 
      differential susceptibility of the two mouse strains. Expression of subsets of 
      miRNAs correlated significantly with peripheral blood granulocyte and monocyte 
      numbers, particularly in DBA/2J mice; miR-223-3p, miR-142-3p, and miR-20b-5p 
      correlated most positively with these cell types in both mouse strains. Higher 
      abundance of antiapoptotic (e.g., miR-467 family) and lower abundance of 
      proapoptotic miRNAs (e.g., miR-34 family) and those regulating the PI3K-Akt 
      pathway (e.g., miR-31-5p) were associated with the more susceptible DBA/2J 
      strain. CONCLUSION: Substantial differences in pulmonary miRNA expression between 
      the two differentially susceptible mouse strains were evident even before 
      infection, but evolved further throughout infection and could in part be 
      attributed to differences in peripheral blood leukocyte populations. Thus, 
      pulmonary miRNA expression both before and during IAV infection is in part 
      determined genetically and contributes to susceptibility to IAV infection in this 
      murine host, and likely in humans.

      pri-miRNA sequences leading to phenotypic variability. This study aims to 
      identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) affecting the expression levels 
      of bone-related mature microRNAs and thus, triggering an osteoporotic phenotype. 
      An association analysis of SNPs located in pri-miRNA sequences with bone mineral 
      density (BMD) was performed in the OSTEOMED2 cohort (n = 2183). Functional 
      studies were performed for assessing the role of BMD-associated miRNAs in bone 
      cells. Two SNPs, rs6430498 in the miR-3679 and rs12512664 in the miR-4274, were 
      significantly associated with femoral neck BMD. Further, we measured these 
      BMD-associated microRNAs in trabecular bone from osteoporotic hip fractures 
      comparing to non-osteoporotic bone by qPCR. Both microRNAs were found 
      overexpressed in fractured bone. Increased matrix mineralization was observed 
      after miR-3679-3p inhibition in human osteoblastic cells. Finally, genotypes of 
      rs6430498 and rs12512664 were correlated with expression levels of miR-3679 and 
      miR-4274, respectively, in osteoblasts. In both cases, the allele that generated 
      higher microRNA expression levels was associated with lower BMD values. In 
      conclusion, two osteoblast-expressed microRNAs, miR-3679 and miR-4274, were 
      associated with BMD; their overexpression could contribute to the osteoporotic 
      phenotype. These findings open new areas for the study of bone disorders.

AB  - BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have great potential serving as tumor biomarkers 
      and therapeutic targets. As the rapid development of high-throughput experimental 
      technology, gene expression experiments have become more and more specialized and 
      diversified. The complex data structure has brought great challenge for the 
      identification of biomarkers. In the meantime, current statistical and machine 
      learning methods for detecting biomarkers have the problem of low reliability and 
      biased criteria. RESULTS: This study aims to select combinatorial miRNA 
      biomarkers, which have higher sensitivity and specificity than single-gene 
      biomarkers. In order to avoid exhaustive search and redundant information, miRNAs 
      are firstly clustered, then the combinations of representative cluster members 
      are assessed as potential biomarkers. Both the criteria for the partition of 
      clusters and selection of representative members are based on Fisher linear 
      discriminant analysis (FDA). The FDA-based criterion has been demonstrated to be 
      superior to three other criteria in selecting representative members, and also 
      good at refining clusters. In the comparison with eight common feature selection 
      methods, this clustering-based method performs the best with regard to the 
      discriminative ability of selected biomarkers. CONCLUSIONS: Our experimental 
      results demonstrate that the clustering-based method can identify microRNA 
      combinatorial biomarkers with high accuracy and efficiency. Our method and data 
      are available to the public upon request.

TI  - Aberrant neuronal activity-induced signaling and gene expression in a mouse model 
      of RASopathy.
PG  - e1006684

AB  - Noonan syndrome (NS) is characterized by reduced growth, craniofacial 
      abnormalities, congenital heart defects, and variable cognitive deficits. NS 
      belongs to the RASopathies, genetic conditions linked to mutations in components 
      and regulators of the Ras signaling pathway. Approximately 50% of NS cases are 
      caused by mutations in PTPN11. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying 
      cognitive impairments in NS patients are still poorly understood. Here, we report 
      the generation and characterization of a new conditional mouse strain that 
      expresses the overactive Ptpn11D61Y allele only in the forebrain. Unlike mice 
      with a global expression of this mutation, this strain is viable and without 
      severe systemic phenotype, but shows lower exploratory activity and reduced 
      memory specificity, which is in line with a causal role of disturbed neuronal 
      Ptpn11 signaling in the development of NS-linked cognitive deficits. To explore 
      the underlying mechanisms we investigated the neuronal activity-regulated Ras 
      signaling in brains and neuronal cultures derived from this model. We observed an 
      altered surface expression and trafficking of synaptic glutamate receptors, which 
      are crucial for hippocampal neuronal plasticity. Furthermore, we show that the 
      neuronal activity-induced ERK signaling, as well as the consecutive regulation of 
      gene expression are strongly perturbed. Microarray-based hippocampal gene 
      expression profiling revealed profound differences in the basal state and upon 
      stimulation of neuronal activity. The neuronal activity-dependent gene regulation 
      was strongly attenuated in Ptpn11D61Y neurons. In silico analysis of functional 
      networks revealed changes in the cellular signaling beyond the dysregulation of 
      Ras/MAPK signaling that is nearly exclusively discussed in the context of NS at 
      present. Importantly, changes in PI3K/AKT/mTOR and JAK/STAT signaling were 
      experimentally confirmed. In summary, this study uncovers aberrant neuronal 
      activity-induced signaling and regulation of gene expression in Ptpn11D61Y mice 
      and suggests that these deficits contribute to the pathophysiology of cognitive 
      impairments in NS.

AB  - MicroRNA is a class of noncoding RNAs able to base pair with complementary 
      messenger RNA sequences, inhibiting their expression. These regulatory molecules 
      play important roles in key cellular processes including cell proliferation, 
      differentiation and response to DNA damage; changes in miRNA expression are a 
      common feature of human cancers. To gain insights into the mechanisms involved in 
      breast cancer progression we conducted a microRNA global expression analysis on a 
      21T series of cell lines obtained from the same patient during different stages 
      of breast cancer progression. These stages are represented by cell lines derived 
      from normal epithelial (H16N2), atypical ductal hyperplasia (21PT), primary in 
      situ ductal carcinoma (21NT) and pleural effusion of a lung metastasis (21MT-1 
      and 21MT-2). In a global microRNA expression analysis, miR-205-5p was the only 
      miRNA to display an important downregulation in the metastatic cell lines 
      (21MT-1; 21MT-2) when compared to the non-invasive cells (21PT and 21NT). The 
      lower amounts of miR-205-5p found also correlated with high histological grades 
      biopsies and with higher invasion rates in a Boyden chamber assay. This work 
      pinpoints miR-205-5p as a potential player in breast tumor invasiveness.

AB  - Obligate intracellular bacteria such as Chlamydia trachomatis depend on 
      metabolites of the host cell and thus protect their sole replication niche by 
      interfering with the host cells' stress response. Here, we investigated the 
      involvement of host microRNAs (miRNAs) in maintaining the viability of C. 
      trachomatis-infected primary human cells. We identified miR-30c-5p as a 
      prominently up-regulated miRNA required for the stable down-regulation of p53, a 
      major suppressor of metabolite supply in C. trachomatis-infected cells. Loss of 
      miR-30c-5p led to the up-regulation of Drp1, a mitochondrial fission regulator 
      and a target gene of p53, which, in turn, severely affected chlamydial growth and 
      had a marked effect on the mitochondrial network. Drp1-induced mitochondrial 
      fragmentation prevented replication of C. trachomatis even in p53-deficient 
      cells. Additionally, Chlamydia maintain mitochondrial integrity during reactive 
      oxygen species-induced stress that occurs naturally during infection. We show 
      that C. trachomatis require mitochondrial ATP for normal development and hence 
      postulate that they preserve mitochondrial integrity through a 
      miR-30c-5p-dependent inhibition of Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fission.

AB  - Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease that is clinically silent until 
      the majority of β cells are destroyed. There is an unmet need for reliable and 
      cost-effective biomarkers to predict and diagnose diabetes at an early stage. A 
      number of stable microRNAs (miRNAs) have been reported in serum and plasma and 
      are now being investigated as biomarkers of different diseases. We measured the 
      levels of 745 miRNAs in sera of children with recent-onset T1D and age-matched 
      controls using locked nucleic acid-enhanced (LNA-enhanced) quantitative PCR 
      profiling. Thirty-five miRNAs were significantly different between the groups, 
      and 27 miRNAs were elevated in T1D. Good discriminating power was obtained for 6 
      miRNAs (miR-454-3p, miR-222-3p, miR-144-5p, miR-345-5p, miR-24-3p, and 
      miR-140-5p), which were not elevated at later stages of diabetes. In silico 
      pathway analysis, based on inferred miRNA target genes, associated 
      glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis as well as PI3K/Akt, MAPK, and Wnt signaling 
      pathways with early stages of T1D. Among the 27 upregulated miRNAs in T1D, 2 
      miRNAs significantly correlated with hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), as did 5 of 8 
      downregulated miRNAs. A total of 134 miRNAs significantly correlated with HbA1c 
      when stratifying hyperglycemia-induced miRNAs from T1D-specific miRNAs. In 
      conclusion, we have identified a serum miRNA pattern of recent-onset T1D and 
      signaling pathways that may be involved in its pathogenesis.

AB  - Ischemic stroke is a major cause of mortality and morbidity globally. Among the 
      ischemic stroke subtypes, cardioembolic stroke is with poor functional outcome 
      (Modified Rankin score ≥ 2). Early diagnosis of cardioembolic stroke will prove 
      beneficial. This study examined the microRNAs targeting cluster of 
      differentiation 46 (CD46), a potential biomarker for cardioembolic stroke. CD46 
      mRNA level was shown to be differentially expressed (p < 0.001) between 
      cardioembolic stroke (median = 1.32) and non-cardioembolic stroke subtypes (large 
      artery stroke median = 5.05; small vessel stroke median = 6.45). Bioinformatic 
      search showed that miR-19a, -20a, -185 and -374b were found to target CD46 mRNA 
      and further verified by luciferase reporter assay. The levels of miRNAs targeting 
      CD46 were significantly reduced (p < 0.05) in non-cardioembolic stroke patients 
      (large artery stroke median: miR-19a = 0.63, miR-20a = 0.42, miR-185 = 0.32, 
      miR-374b = 0.27; small artery stroke median: miR-19a = 0.07, miR-20a = 0.06, 
      miR-185 = 0.07, miR-374b = 0.05) as compared to cardioembolic stroke patients 
      (median: miR-19a = 2.69, miR-20a = 1.36, miR-185 = 1.05, miR-374b = 1.23). ROC 
      curve showed that the miRNAs could distinguish cardioembolic stroke from 
      non-cardioembolic stroke with better AUC value as compared to CD46. Endogenous 
      expression of CD46 in Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVECs) were found 
      to be regulated by miR-19a and miR-20a. Thus implicating that miR-19a and -20a 
      may play a role in pathogenesis of cardioembolic stroke, possibly via the 
      endothelial cells.

AB  - Lyme disease is caused by infection with the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb), 
      which is transmitted to humans by deer ticks. The infection manifests usually as 
      a rash and minor systemic symptoms; however, the bacteria can spread to other 
      tissues, causing joint pain, carditis, and neurological symptoms. Lyme 
      neuroborreliosis presents itself in several ways, such as Bell's palsy, 
      meningitis, and encephalitis. The molecular basis for neuroborreliosis is poorly 
      understood. Analysis of the changes in the expression levels of messenger RNAs 
      and non-coding RNAs, including microRNAs, following Bb infection could therefore 
      provide vital information on the pathogenesis and clinical symptoms of 
      neuroborreliosis. To this end, we used cultured primary human astrocytes, key 
      responders to CNS infection and important components of the blood-brain barrier, 
      as a model system to study RNA and microRNA changes in the CNS caused by Bb. 
      Using whole transcriptome RNA-seq, we found significant changes in 38 microRNAs 
      and 275 mRNAs at 24 and 48 hours following Bb infection. Several of the RNA 
      changes affect pathways involved in immune response, development, chromatin 
      assembly (including histones) and cell adhesion. Further, several of the microRNA 
      predicted target mRNAs were also differentially regulated. Overall, our results 
      indicate that exposure to Bb causes significant changes to the transcriptome and 
      microRNA profile of astrocytes, which has implications in the pathogenesis, and 
      hence potential treatment strategies to combat this disease.

AB  - Investigation of human CNS disease and drug effects has been hampered by the lack 
      of a system that enables single-cell analysis of live adult patient brain cells. 
      We developed a culturing system, based on a papain-aided procedure, for resected 
      adult human brain tissue removed during neurosurgery. We performed single-cell 
      transcriptomics on over 300 cells, permitting identification of oligodendrocytes, 
      microglia, neurons, endothelial cells, and astrocytes after 3 weeks in culture. 
      Using deep sequencing, we detected over 12,000 expressed genes, including 
      hundreds of cell-type-enriched mRNAs, lncRNAs and pri-miRNAs. We describe 
      cell-type- and patient-specific transcriptional hierarchies. Single-cell 
      transcriptomics on cultured live adult patient derived cells is a prime example 
      of the promise of personalized precision medicine. Because these cells derive 
      from subjects ranging in age into their sixties, this system permits human aging 
      studies previously possible only in rodent systems.

AB  - Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) orchestrate tissue repair by releasing 
      cell-derived microvesicles (MVs), which, presumably by small RNA species, 
      modulate global gene expression. The knowledge of miRNA/mRNA signatures linked to 
      a reparative status may elucidate some of the molecular events associated with 
      MSC protection. Here, we used a model of cisplatin-induced kidney injury (acute 
      kidney injury) to assess how MSCs or MVs could restore tissue function. MSCs and 
      MVs presented similar protective effects, which were evidenced in vivo and in 
      vitro by modulating apoptosis, inflammation, oxidative stress, and a set of 
      prosurvival molecules. In addition, we observed that miRNAs (i.e., miR-880, 
      miR-141, miR-377, and miR-21) were modulated, thereby showing active 
      participation on regenerative process. Subsequently, we identified that MSC 
      regulates a particular miRNA subset which mRNA targets are associated with 
      Wnt/TGF-β, fibrosis, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition signaling pathways. 
      Our results suggest that MSCs release MVs that transcriptionally reprogram 
      injured cells, thereby modulating a specific miRNA-mRNA network.

TI  - MicroRNAs and tRNA-derived fragments predict the transformation of 
      myelodysplastic syndromes to acute myeloid leukemia.
PG  - 1-15
LID - 10.1080/10428194.2016.1272680 [doi]
AB  - Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are clonal hematopoietic disorders of the elderly 
      that carry an increased risk of progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). 
      Since small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs), including microRNA (miRNAs), act as 
      regulators of cellular differentiation, we hypothesized that changes to sRNAs 
      might be implicated in the progression of MDS to AML. We conducted sRNA 
      sequencing on three sets of patients: Group A (MDS patients who never progressed 
      to AML); Group B (MDS patients who later progressed to an AML); and Group C (AML 
      patients with myelodysplasia-related changes, including patients with a known 
      preceding diagnosis of MDS). We identified five miRNAs that differentiated Groups 
      A and B, independent of bone marrow blast percentage, including three members of 
      the miR-181 family, as well as differential patterns of miRNA isoforms (isomiRs) 
      and tDRs. Thus, we have identified sRNA biomarkers that predict MDS cases that 
      are likely to progress to AML.

TI  - MicroRNA Expression Shows Inflammatory Dysregulation and Tumor-Like Proliferative 
      Responses in Joints of Patients With Postinfectious Lyme Arthritis.
PG  - 1100-1110
LID - 10.1002/art.40039 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Lyme arthritis (LA) is caused by infection with Borrelia burgdorferi 
      and usually resolves following spirochetal killing with antibiotics. However, in 
      some patients, arthritis persists after antibiotic therapy. To provide insights 
      into underlying pathogenic processes associated with antibiotic-refractory LA 
      (postinfectious LA), we analyzed differences in microRNA (miRNA) expression 
      between LA patients with active infection and those with postinfectious LA. 
      METHODS: MicroRNA expression was assayed in synovial fluid (SF) from LA patients 
      before and after oral and intravenous antibiotic therapy, and in synovial tissue 
      obtained months after antibiotic therapy from patients with postinfectious LA. SF 
      and tissue from patients with other forms of arthritis, such as rheumatoid 
      arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis, were used for comparison. RESULTS: SF from LA 
      patients during active infection had marked elevations of white blood cells, 
      particularly polymorphonuclear leukocytes, accompanied by elevated levels of 
      microRNA-223 (miR-223). In contrast, SF from postantibiotic LA patients contained 
      greater percentages of lymphocytes and mononuclear cells. SF from postantibiotic 
      LA patients also exhibited marked inflammatory (miR-146a, miR-155), wound repair 
      (miR-142), and proliferative (miR-17-92) miRNA signatures, and higher levels of 
      these miRNAs correlated with longer arthritis duration. Levels of miR-146a, 
      miR-155, miR-142, miR-223, and miR-17-92 were also elevated in synovial tissue in 
      late postinfectious LA, and levels of let-7a were reduced, similar to RA. 
      CONCLUSION: During active infection, miRNA expression in SF reflected an immune 
      response associated with bacterial killing, while in postinfectious LA, miRNA 
      expression in SF and synovial tissue reflected chronic inflammation, synovial 
      proliferation, and breakdown of wound repair processes, showing that the nature 
      of the arthritis was altered after spirochetal killing.

TI  - HTP Nutraceutical Screening for Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors and Effects of 
      HDACis on Tumor-suppressing miRNAs by Trichostatin A and Grapeseed (Vitis 
      vinifera) in HeLa cells.
PG  - 17-33
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Aggressive tumor malignancies are a consequence of delayed 
      diagnosis, epigenetic/phenotype changes and chemo-radiation resistance. Histone 
      deacetylases (HDACs) are a major epigenetic regulator of transcriptional 
      repression, which are highly overexpressed in advanced malignancy. While original 
      chemotherapy drugs were modeled after phytochemicals elucidated by botanical 
      screenings, HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) such as apicidin, trichostatin A (TSA) and 
      butyrate were discovered as products of fungus and microbes, in particular, gut 
      microbiota. Therefore, a persistent question remains as to the inherent existence 
      of HDACis in raw undigested dietary plant material. In this study, we conduct a 
      high-throughput (HTP) screening of ~1,600 non-fermented commonly used 
      nutraceuticals (spices, herbs, teas, vegetables, fruits, seeds, rinds etc.) at 
      (<600 μg/ml) and food-based polyphenolics (<240 μg/ml) for evidence of HDAC 
      activity inhibition in nuclear HeLa cell lysates. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human 
      HDAC kinetic validation was performed using a standard fluorometric activity 
      assay, followed by an enzymatic-linked immuno-captured ELISA. Both methods were 
      verified using HDACi panel drugs: TSA, apicidin, suberohydroxamic acid, M344, 
      CL-994, valproic acid and sodium phenylbutyrate. The HTP screening was then 
      conducted, followed by a study comparing biological effects of HDACis in HeLa 
      cells, including analysis of whole-transcriptome non-coding RNAs using Affymetrix 
      miRNA 4.1-panel arrays. RESULTS: The HTP screening results confirmed 44/1600 as 
      potential HDACis to which 31 were further eliminated as false-positives. 
      Methodological challenges/concerns are addressed regarding plant product 
      false-positives that arise from the signal reduction of commercial lysine 
      development reagents. Only 13 HDACis were found having an IC(50) under <200 
      μg/ml: Grapeseed extract (Vitis vinifera), Great burnet root (Sanguisorba 
      Officinalis), Babul (Acacia arabica), Chinese gallnut (Melaphis chinensis), 
      Konaberry extract (Coffea arabica), Uva Ursi (Arctostaphylos uva ursi), Green tea 
      (Camellia sinensis), Meadowsweet (Filipendula ulmaria), Sassafras (Sassafras 
      officinale), Turkey rhubarb (Rheum palmatum), epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), 
      gossypol and gallic acid. Next, we investigate the biological consequence of 
      HDACi panel drugs in HeLa cells, where the data suggest predominant effects are 
      anti-mitotic rather than cytotoxic. Lastly, differential effects of TSA vs. GSE 
      at sub-lethal concentrations tested on HeLa cells show 6,631 miRNAs expressed in 
      resting cells, 35 significantly up-regulated (TSA) and 81 up-regulated (GSE), 
      with several miRNAs overlapping in the upward direction by both GSE and TSA (e.g. 
      hsa-miR-23b-5p, hsa-miR-27b-5p, hsa-miR-1180-3p, hsa-miR-6880-5p and 
      hsa-mir-943). Using DIANA miRNA online tools, it was determined that GSE and TSA 
      simultaneously cause overexpression of similar miRNAs predicted to destroy the 
      following influential oncogenes: NFkB, NRAS, KRAS, HRAS, MYC, TGFBR1, E2F1, E2F2, 
      BCL21, CDKN1A, CDK6, HIF1a, and VEGFA. CONCLUSION: The data from this study show 
      that plant- based HDACis are relatively rare, and can elicit a similar pattern to 
      TSA in up-regulating miRNAs involved with tumor suppression of HeLa cervical 
      carcinoma.

      cancer.

AB  - Prostate cancer (PC) is the most common and the second leading cause of 
      cancer-related death among American men. Early diagnosis is a prerequisite to 
      improving therapeutic benefits. However, the current clinical biomarkers for PC 
      do not reliably decipher indolent PC from other urogenital disorders. Thus, 
      effective clinical intervention necessitates development of new biomarkers for 
      early detection of PC. The present study aimed to identify the miRNA signature in 
      organ-confined (Gleason Score 6) prostate tumors. MicroRNA (miRNA/miR) array 
      analysis identified 118 upregulated and 73 downregulated miRNAs in microdissected 
      tumors in comparison to matched neighboring normal prostate epithelium. The 
      miRs-Plus-A1083, -92b-5p, -18a-3p, -19a-3p, -639, -3622b-3p, -3189-3p, -155-3p, 
      -410, -1179, 548b-5p, and -4469 are predominantly expressed (7-11-fold), whereas 
      miRs-595, 4490, -3120-5p, -1299, -21-5p, -3677-3, -let-7b-5p, -5189, 3-121-5p, 
      -4518, -200a-5p, -3682-5p, -3689d, -3149 represent the most downregulated 
      (12-113-fold) miRNAs in microdissected prostate tumors. The array expression 
      profile of selected miRNA signature and their potential mRNA targets was 
      validated by qRT-PCR analysis in PC cell lines. Integrated in silico and 
      computational prediction analyses demonstrated that the dysregulated miRNA 
      signature map to key regulatory factors involved in tumorigenesis, including cell 
      cycle, apoptosis, and p53 pathways. The newly identified miRNA signature has 
      potential clinical utility as biomarkers, prognostic indicators, and therapeutic 
      targets for early detection of PC. Further studies are needed to assess the 
      functional significance and clinical usefulness of the identified miRNAs. Impact 
      Statement To our knowledge his is the first study of identifying miRNA signatures 
      in microdissected indolent (Gleason score 6) prostate cancer in comparison to 
      matched normal prostate epithelium. By employing in silico and computational 
      prediction analysis, the study provides a landscape of potential miRNA targets 
      and key cellular pathways involved in prostate tumorigenesis. Identification if 
      miRNAs and their relevant targets and pathways pave the way for underpinning 
      their mechanistic role of miRNAs in human prostate tumorigenesis, and possibly 
      other human cancers. Importantly, the outcome of the study has important clinical 
      implications for the management of prostate cancer, including the use of miRNA(s) 
      as biomarkers for early detection of prostate cancer.

AB  - MicroRNAs play important roles in the development of many complex diseases. 
      Because of their importance, the analysis of signaling pathways including miRNA 
      interactions holds the potential for unveiling the mechanisms underlying such 
      diseases. However, current signaling pathway databases are limited to 
      interactions between genes and ignore miRNAs. Here, we use the information on 
      miRNA targets to build a database of miRNA-augmented pathways (mirAP), and we 
      show its application in the contexts of integrative pathway analysis and disease 
      subtyping. Our miRNA-mRNA integrative pathway analysis pipeline incorporates a 
      topology-aware approach that we previously implemented. Our integrative disease 
      subtyping pipeline takes into account survival data, gene and miRNA expression, 
      and knowledge of the interactions among genes. We demonstrate the advantages of 
      our approach by analyzing nine sample-matched datasets that provide both miRNA 
      and mRNA expression. We show that integrating miRNAs into pathway analysis 
      results in greater statistical power, and provides a more comprehensive view of 
      the underlying phenomena. We also compare our disease subtyping method with the 
      state-of-the-art integrative analysis by analyzing a colorectal cancer database 
      from TCGA. The colorectal cancer subtypes identified by our approach are 
      significantly different in terms of their survival expectation. These 
      miRNA-augmented pathways offer a more comprehensive view and a deeper 
      understanding of biological pathways. A better understanding of the molecular 
      processes associated with patients' survival can help to a better prognosis and 
      an appropriate treatment for each subtype.

LID - 10.1093/nar/gkw926 [doi]
AB  - In the last decade, miRNAs and their regulatory mechanisms have been intensively 
      studied and many tools for the analysis of miRNAs and their targets have been 
      developed. We previously presented a dictionary on single miRNAs and their 
      putative target pathways. Since then, the number of miRNAs has tripled and the 
      knowledge on miRNAs and targets has grown substantially. This, along with changes 
      in pathway resources such as KEGG, leads to an improved understanding of miRNAs, 
      their target genes and related pathways. Here, we introduce the miRNA Pathway 
      Dictionary Database (miRPathDB), freely accessible at 
      https://mpd.bioinf.uni-sb.de/ With the database we aim to complement available 
      target pathway web-servers by providing researchers easy access to the 
      information which pathways are regulated by a miRNA, which miRNAs target a 
      pathway and how specific these regulations are. The database contains a large 
      number of miRNAs (2595 human miRNAs), different miRNA target sets (14 773 
      experimentally validated target genes as well as 19 281 predicted targets genes) 
      and a broad selection of functional biochemical categories (KEGG-, WikiPathways-, 
      BioCarta-, SMPDB-, PID-, Reactome pathways, functional categories from gene 
      ontology (GO), protein families from Pfam and chromosomal locations totaling 12 
      875 categories). In addition to Homo sapiens, also Mus musculus data are stored 
      and can be compared to human target pathways.

AB  - Particulate matter (PM) exposure during in utero life may entail adverse health 
      outcomes in later-life. Air pollution's adverse effects are known to alter gene 
      expression profiles, which can be regulated by microRNAs (miRNAs). We investigate 
      the potential influence of air pollution exposure in prenatal life on placental 
      miRNA expression. Within the framework of the ENVIRONAGE birth cohort, we 
      measured the expression of six candidate miRNAs in placental tissue from 210 
      mother-newborn pairs by qRT-PCR. Trimester-specific PM(2.5) exposure levels were 
      estimated for each mother's home address using a spatiotemporal model. Multiple 
      regression models were used to study miRNA expression and in utero exposure to 
      PM(2.5) over various time windows during pregnancy. The placental expression of 
      miR-21 (-33.7%, 95% CI: -53.2 to -6.2, P = 0.022), miR-146a (-30.9%, 95% CI: 
      -48.0 to -8.1, P = 0.012) and miR-222 (-25.4%, 95% CI: -43.0 to -2.4, P = 0.034) 
      was inversely associated with PM(2.5) exposure during the 2nd trimester of 
      pregnancy, while placental expression of miR-20a and miR-21 was positively 
      associated with 1st trimester exposure. Tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin 
      homolog (PTEN) was identified as a common target of the miRNAs significantly 
      associated with PM exposure. Placental PTEN expression was strongly and 
      positively associated (+59.6% per 5 µg/m³ increment, 95% CI: 26.9 to 100.7, P < 
      0.0001) with 3rd trimester PM(2.5) exposure. Further research is required to 
      establish the role these early miRNA and mRNA expression changes might play in 
      PM-induced health effects. We provide molecular evidence showing that in utero 
      PM(2.5) exposure affects miRNAs expression as well as its downstream target PTEN.
