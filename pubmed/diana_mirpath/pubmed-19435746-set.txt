AB  - Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) is one of the most prevalent mental disorders 
      worldwide. Considering the widespread occurrence of AUD, a reliable, cheap, 
      non-invasive biomarker of alcohol consumption is desired by healthcare providers, 
      clinicians, researchers, public health and criminal justice officials. microRNAs 
      could serve as such biomarkers. They are easily detectable in saliva, which can 
      be sampled from individuals in a non-invasive manner. Moreover, microRNAs 
      expression is dynamically regulated by environmental factors, including alcohol. 
      Since excessive alcohol consumption is a hallmark of alcohol abuse, we have 
      profiled microRNA expression in the saliva of chronic, heavy alcohol abusers 
      using microRNA microarrays. We observed significant changes in salivary microRNA 
      expression caused by excessive alcohol consumption. These changes fell into three 
      categories: downregulated microRNAs, upregulated microRNAs, and microRNAs 
      upregulated de novo. Analysis of these combinatorial changes in microRNA 
      expression suggests dysregulation of specific biological pathways leading to 
      impairment of the immune system and development of several types of epithelial 
      cancer. Moreover, some of the altered microRNAs are also modulators of 
      inflammation, suggesting their contribution to pro-inflammatory mechanisms of 
      alcohol actions. Establishment of the cellular source of microRNAs in saliva 
      corroborated these results. We determined that most of the microRNAs in saliva 
      come from two types of cells: leukocytes involved in immune responses and 
      inflammation, and buccal cells, involved in development of epithelial, oral 
      cancers. In summary, we propose that microRNA profiling in saliva can be a 
      useful, non-invasive biomarker allowing the monitoring of alcohol abuse, as well 
      as alcohol-related inflammation and early detection of cancer.

      Encephalitis and Herpes Simplex Encephalitis.
PG  - 2441-2455
LID - 10.1007/s12035-021-02705-2 [doi]
AB  - Encephalitis mediated by autoantibodies against neuronal antigens and herpes 
      simplex encephalitis (HSE) are seemingly separate causes of encephalopathy in 
      adults. Autoimmune encephalitis (AE) is autoimmune in origin, and herpes simplex 
      encephalitis is infectious. The purpose of this study was to examine the role of 
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) exosomes from patients with antibody-positive AE and 
      HSE. Towards this, exosomes were isolated from CSF from 13 patients with 
      anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis, 11 patients with 
      anti-gamma-aminobutyric acid-B (GABAB) receptor encephalitis, 9 patients with 
      anti-leucine-rich glioma-inactivated 1 (LGI1) encephalitis, and 8 patients with 
      anti-contactin-associated protein-like 2 (CASPR2) encephalitis, and 12 control 
      individuals negative of antibodies against neuronal autoantigens. There were ten 
      miRNAs highly expressed in patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis compared to 
      those in control subjects. Eight miRNAs were found to be lower expressed in 
      anti-NMDAR encephalitis CSF-derived exosomes. Furthermore, Kyoto Encyclopedia of 
      Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways enriched by AE differential expressed exosomic 
      miRNAs demonstrated that AE-related exosomic miRNAs may participate as a feedback 
      regulation in cancer development. In addition, the exosome concentration in CSF 
      of 9 HSE patients was significantly higher compared to those from 9 HSV( -) 
      patients. This observation was consistent with the results that exosome 
      concentration was found to be higher in the animal model which was inoculated 
      intranasally with HSV-1 compared to controls. Furthermore, western blot 
      demonstrated that the subunits of NMDAR, GABA(B)R, and AMPAR were detected highly 
      expressed in exosomes derived from sera of HSV-1-treated animal model compared to 
      controls. More importantly, exosomes isolated from CSF of HSE patients contained 
      higher expression levels of two miRNAs encoded by HSV, miR-H2-3p, and miR-H4-3p 
      compared to those from HSV( -) patients. In summary, HSV may trigger brain 
      autoimmunity in HSE by presentation of surface autoantigens via exosomes.

AB  - Ovarian cancer is a major gynaecological malignant tumor associated with a high 
      mortality rate. Identifying survival-related variants may improve treatment and 
      survival in patients with ovarian cancer. In this work, we proposed a support 
      vector regression (SVR)-based method called OV-SURV, which is incorporated with 
      an inheritable bi-objective combinatorial genetic algorithm for feature selection 
      to identify a miRNA signature associated with survival in patients with ovarian 
      cancer. There were 209 patients with miRNA expression profiles and survival 
      information of ovarian cancer retrieved from The Cancer Genome Atlas database. 
      OV-SURV achieved a mean correlation coefficient of 0.77±0.01and a mean absolute 
      error of 0.69±0.02 years using 10-fold cross-validation. Analysis of the top 
      ranked miRNAs revealed that the miRNAs, hsa-let-7f, hsa-miR-1237, hsa-miR-98, 
      hsa-miR-933, and hsa-miR-889, were significantly associated with the survival in 
      patients with ovarian cancer. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway 
      analysis revealed that four of these miRNAs, hsa-miR-182, hsa-miR-34a, 
      hsa-miR-342, and hsa-miR-1304, were highly enriched in fatty acid biosynthesis, 
      and the five miRNAs, hsa-let-7f, hsa-miR-34a, hsa-miR-342, hsa-miR-1304, and 
      hsa-miR-24, were highly enriched in fatty acid metabolism. The prediction model 
      with the identified miRNA signature consisting of prognostic biomarkers can 
      benefit therapeutic decision making of ovarian cancer.

TI  - miRNA profiling of primate cervicovaginal lavage and extracellular vesicles 
      reveals miR-186-5p as a potential antiretroviral factor in macrophages.
PG  - 2021-2039
LID - 10.1002/2211-5463.12952 [doi]
AB  - Cervicovaginal secretions, or their components collected, are referred to as 
      cervicovaginal lavage (CVL). CVL constituents have utility as biomarkers and play 
      protective roles in wound healing and against HIV-1 infection. However, several 
      components of cervicovaginal fluids are less well understood, such as 
      extracellular RNAs and their carriers, for example, extracellular vesicles (EVs). 
      EVs comprise a wide array of double-leaflet membrane extracellular particles and 
      range in diameter from 30 nm to over one micron. The aim of this study was to 
      determine whether differentially regulated CVL microRNAs (miRNAs) might influence 
      retrovirus replication. To this end, we characterized EVs and miRNAs of primate 
      CVL during the menstrual cycle and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection 
      of macaques. EVs were enriched by stepped ultracentrifugation, and miRNA profiles 
      were assessed with a medium-throughput stem-loop/hydrolysis probe qPCR platform. 
      Whereas hormone cycling was abnormal in infected subjects, EV concentration 
      correlated with progesterone concentration in uninfected subjects. miRNAs were 
      present predominantly in the EV-depleted CVL supernatant. Only a small number of 
      CVL miRNAs changed during the menstrual cycle or SIV infection, for example, 
      miR-186-5p, which was depleted in retroviral infection. This miRNA inhibited HIV 
      replication in infected macrophages in vitro. In silico target prediction and 
      pathway enrichment analyses shed light on the probable functions of miR-186-5p in 
      hindering HIV infections via immunoregulation, T-cell regulation, disruption of 
      viral pathways, etc. These results provide further evidence for the potential of 
      EVs and small RNAs as biomarkers or effectors of disease processes in the 
      reproductive tract.

TI  - Personal Medicine and Bone Metastases: Biomarkers, Micro-RNAs and Bone 
      Metastases.

AB  - Bone metastasis is a major cause of morbidity within solid tumours of the breast, 
      prostate, lung and kidney. Metastasis to the skeleton is associated with a wide 
      range of complications including bone fractures, spinal cord compression, 
      hypercalcaemia and increased bone pain. Improved treatments for bone metastasis, 
      such as the use of anti-bone resorptive bisphosphonate agents, within 
      post-menopausal women have improved disease-free survival; however, these 
      treatments are not without side effects. There is thus a need for biomarkers, 
      which will predict the risk of developing the spread to bone within these 
      cancers. The application of molecular profiling techniques, together with animal 
      model systems and engineered cell-lines has enabled the identification of a 
      series of potential bone-metastasis biomarker molecules predictive of bone 
      metastasis risk. Some of these biomarker candidates have been validated within 
      patient-derived samples providing a step towards clinical utility. Recent 
      developments in multiplex biomarker quantification now enable the simultaneous 
      measurement of up to 96 micro-RNA/protein molecules in a spatially defined manner 
      with single-cell resolution, thus enabling the characterisation of the key 
      molecules active at the sites of pre-metastatic niche formation as well as 
      tumour-stroma signalling. These technologies have considerable potential to 
      inform biomarker discovery. Additionally, a potential future extension of these 
      discoveries could also be the identification of novel drug targets within cancer 
      spread to bone. This chapter summarises recent findings in biomarker discovery 
      within the key bone metastatic cancers (breast, prostate, lung and renal cell 
      carcinoma). Tissue-based and circulating blood-based biomarkers are discussed 
      from the fields of genomics, epigenetic regulation (micro-RNAs) and 
      protein/cell-signalling together with a discussion of the potential future 
      development of these markers towards clinical development.

TI  - A five-microRNA signature for individualized prognosis evaluation and 
      radiotherapy guidance in patients with diffuse lower-grade glioma.
PG  - 7504-7514
LID - 10.1111/jcmm.15377 [doi]
AB  - Despite the prognostic value of IDH and other gene mutations found in diffuse 
      glioma, markers that judge individual prognosis of patients with diffuse 
      lower-grade glioma (LGG) are still lacking. This study aims to develop an 
      expression-based microRNA signature to provide survival and radiotherapeutic 
      response prediction for LGG patients. MicroRNA expression profiles and relevant 
      clinical information of LGG patients were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas 
      (TCGA; the training group) and the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA; the test 
      group). Cox regression analysis, random survival forests-variable hunting (RSFVH) 
      screening and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) were used to identify the 
      prognostic microRNA signature. ROC and TimeROC curves were plotted to compare the 
      predictive ability of IDH mutation and the signature. Stratification analysis was 
      conducted in patients with radiotherapy information. Gene ontology (GO) analysis 
      and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis were 
      performed to explore the biological function of the signature. We identified a 
      five-microRNA signature that can classify patients into low-risk or high-risk 
      group with significantly different survival in the training and test datasets 
      (P < 0.001). The five-microRNA signature was proved to be superior to IDH 
      mutation in survival prediction (AUCtraining = 0.688 vs 0.607). Stratification 
      analysis found the signature could further divide patients after radiotherapy 
      into two risk groups. GO and KEGG analyses revealed that microRNAs from the 
      prognostic signature were mainly enriched in cancer-associated pathways. The 
      newly discovered five-microRNA signature could predict survival and 
      radiotherapeutic response of LGG patients based on individual microRNA 
      expression.

TI  - Cardiovascular Risk and Resilience Among Black Adults: Rationale and Design of 
      the MECA Study.
PG  - e015247
LID - 10.1161/JAHA.119.015247 [doi]
LID - e015247
AB  - Background Cardiovascular disease incidence, prevalence, morbidity, and mortality 
      have declined in the past several decades; however, disparities persist among 
      subsets of the population. Notably, blacks have not experienced the same 
      improvements on the whole as whites. Furthermore, frequent reports of relatively 
      poorer health statistics among the black population have led to a broad 
      assumption that black race reliably predicts relatively poorer health outcomes. 
      However, substantial intraethnic and intraracial heterogeneity exists; moreover, 
      individuals with similar risk factors and environmental exposures are often known 
      to experience vastly different cardiovascular health outcomes. Thus, some 
      individuals have good outcomes even in the presence of cardiovascular risk 
      factors, a concept known as resilience. Methods and Results The MECA 
      (Morehouse-Emory Center for Health Equity) Study was designed to investigate the 
      multilevel exposures that contribute to "resilience" in the face of risk for poor 
      cardiovascular health among blacks in the greater Atlanta, GA, metropolitan area. 
      We used census tract data to determine "at-risk" and "resilient" neighborhoods 
      with high or low prevalence of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, based on 
      cardiovascular death, hospitalization, and emergency department visits for 
      blacks. More than 1400 individuals from these census tracts assented to 
      demographic, health, and psychosocial questionnaires administered through 
      telephone surveys. Afterwards, ≈500 individuals were recruited to enroll in a 
      clinical study, where risk biomarkers, such as oxidative stress, and inflammatory 
      markers, endothelial progenitor cells, metabolomic and microRNA profiles, and 
      subclinical vascular dysfunction were measured. In addition, comprehensive 
      behavioral questionnaires were collected and ideal cardiovascular health metrics 
      were assessed using the American Heart Association's Life Simple 7 measure. Last, 
      150 individuals with low Life Simple 7 were recruited and randomized to a 
      behavioral mobile health (eHealth) plus health coach or eHealth only intervention 
      and followed up for improvement. Conclusions The MECA Study is investigating 
      socioenvironmental and individual behavioral measures that promote resilience to 
      cardiovascular disease in blacks by assessing biological, functional, and 
      molecular mechanisms. REGISTRATION URL: https://www.clini​caltr​ials.gov. Unique

AB  - Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) causes serious respiratory tract illness and 
      substantial morbidity and some mortality in populations at the extremes of age, 
      i.e., infants, young children, and the elderly. To date, RSV vaccine development 
      has been unsuccessful, a feature linked to the lack of biomarkers available to 
      assess the safety and efficacy of RSV vaccine candidates. We examined microRNAs 
      (miR) as potential biomarkers for different types of RSV vaccine candidates. In 
      this study, mice were vaccinated with a live attenuated RSV candidate that lacks 
      the small hydrophobic (SH) and attachment (G) proteins (CP52), an RSV G protein 
      microparticle (GA2-MP) vaccine, a formalin-inactivated RSV (FI-RSV) vaccine or 
      were mock-treated. Several immunological endpoints and miR expression profiles 
      were determined in mouse serum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) following vaccine 
      priming, boost, and RSV challenge. We identified miRs that were linked with 
      immunological parameters of disease and protection. We show that miRs are 
      potential biomarkers providing valuable insights for vaccine development.

PG  - 2077-2084
LID - 10.3892/etm.2019.7190 [doi]
AB  - Certain microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) may be used as prognostic biomarkers in various 
      types of cancer. The purpose of the present study was to identify miRNAs that 
      were abnormally expressed in glioma of different grades, and to evaluate their 
      clinical implications in patients with glioma. The differentially expressed 
      miRNAs were evaluated from the expression profiles of six glioma tissues (three 
      low-grade and three high-grade gliomas) determined using a microarray platform. 
      Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis was used to 
      further verify the aberrant expression of the candidate miRNA in a set of 42 
      patients and 5 healthy controls. The miRNA target genes were predicted and the 
      protein-protein interaction network was generated; furthermore, functional 
      enrichment analysis of the target genes in Gene Ontology (GO) terms and Kyoto 
      Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways was performed. Kaplan-Meier 
      curves and Log-rank analysis, as well as multivariate Cox regression analysis 
      were performed to assess the association of the candidate miRNA with patient 
      survival. A total of 15 differentially expressed miRNAs, including 13 
      downregulated and 2 upregulated miRNAs, were identified by comparison of 
      low-grade and high-grade glioma tissues. The miR-374a expression of high-grade 
      gliomas was significantly lower than that of low-grade gliomas (fold change, 
      -4.43; P=0.027). The expression levels of miR-374a gradually decreased with the 
      increase of the pathological grade of glioma. Pearson's Chi-square test was used 
      to determine the association of miR-374a expression with several 
      clinicopathological factors. Furthermore, low expression of miR-374a was 
      determined to be an independent prognostic marker and that it was significantly 
      associated with overall survival (P=0.0213). GO and KEGG pathway analysis 
      revealed that the target genes of miR-374a may be involved in the regulation of 
      the RNA polymerase II promoter and mTOR signaling pathway. The four hub genes 
      (CCND1, SP1, CDK4, CDK6) were also identified by PPI network analysis. In 
      conclusion, the present study indicated that miR-374a may be used as a promising 
      prognostic biomarker for the screening of high-risk populations and for the 
      assessment of the prognosis of patients with glioma.

TI  - Using Extracellular Circulating microRNAs to Classify the Etiological Subtypes of 
      Ischemic Stroke.
PG  - 352-361
LID - 10.1007/s12975-018-0659-2 [doi]
AB  - There is no effective biological method to classify ischemic stroke subtypes. In 
      this study, we first performed a systematical gene array study on serum microRNAs 
      with different ischemic stroke subtypes including 13 normal control subjects 
      (NCs) and 87 ischemic stroke (IS) patients including 23 cardioembolism (CARD), 26 
      large artery atherosclerosis (LAA), 27 lacunar infarct (LAC), and 11 stroke of 
      undetermined etiology (SUE). Validation was performed by using an independent 
      cohort of 20 NCs and 85 IS patients including 28 CARD, 23 LAA, 18 LAC, and 16 
      SUE. In the pilot discovery gene array study, we found specific serum microRNA 
      signatures between different ischemic stroke subtypes (CARD, LAA, LAC, and SUE). 
      We further validated 6 microRNAs [miR-125b, miR-125a, let-7b, let-7e, miR-7-2-3p, 
      miR-1908] in a different group of ischemic stroke subtypes by using an 
      independent cohort of 20 NCs, 28 CARD, 23 LAA, 18 LAC, and 16 SUE. Moreover, 
      these circulating miRNAs were further detected to be differentially expressed 
      between pre- vs. post-stroke in different ischemic stroke subtypes. The ROC 
      analysis showed that miR-125b, miR-125a, let-7b, and let-7e could discriminate 
      CARD patients from normal controls and other subtypes. Furthermore, ROC curves 
      shown that miR-7-2-3p and miR-1908 showed significant area-under-the-curve values 
      in both LAA and LAC patients. In conclusion, these results demonstrated that 
      circulating miRNAs in sera could be potentially novel risk factors that involve 
      in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke subtypes.

      therapeutic potential.
PG  - 2115-2136
LID - 10.1084/jem.20171312 [doi]
AB  - We have shown that antagomiR inhibition of miRNA miR-21 and miR-196b activity is 
      sufficient to ablate MLL-AF9 leukemia stem cells (LSC) in vivo. Here, we used an 
      shRNA screening approach to mimic miRNA activity on experimentally verified 
      miR-196b targets to identify functionally important and therapeutically relevant 
      pathways downstream of oncogenic miRNA in MLL-r AML. We found Cdkn1b (p27(Kip1)) 
      is a direct miR-196b target whose repression enhanced an embryonic stem cell-like 
      signature associated with decreased leukemia latency and increased numbers of 
      leukemia stem cells in vivo. Conversely, elevation of p27(Kip1) significantly 
      reduced MLL-r leukemia self-renewal, promoted monocytic differentiation of 
      leukemic blasts, and induced cell death. Antagonism of miR-196b activity or 
      pharmacologic inhibition of the Cks1-Skp2-containing SCF E3-ubiquitin ligase 
      complex increased p27(Kip1) and inhibited human AML growth. This work illustrates 
      that understanding oncogenic miRNA target pathways can identify actionable 
      targets in leukemia.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second-most-frequent neurodegenerative disorder 
      worldwide. One major hallmark of PD is the degeneration of dopaminergic (DA) 
      neurons in the substantia nigra. Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor 
      (GDNF) potently increases DA neuron survival in models of PD; however, the 
      underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, 
      non-coding RNAs that are important for post-transcriptional regulation of gene 
      expression. Using small RNA sequencing, we show that GDNF specifically increases 
      the expression of miR-182-5p and miR-183-5p in primary midbrain neurons (PMNs). 
      Transfection of synthetic miR-182-5p and miR-183-5p mimics leads to increased 
      neurite outgrowth and mediates neuroprotection of DA neurons in vitro and 
      in vivo, mimicking GDNF effects. This is accompanied by decreased expression of 
      FOXO3 and FOXO1 transcription factors and increased PI3K-Akt signaling. 
      Inhibition of endogenous miR-182-5p or miR-183-5p in GDNF-treated PMNs attenuated 
      the pro-DA effects of GDNF. These findings unveil an unknown miR-mediated 
      mechanism of GDNF action and suggest that targeting miRNAs is a new therapeutic 
      avenue to PD phenotypes.

AB  - Oxidative stress can alter the expression level of many microRNAs (miRNAs), but 
      how these changes are integrated and related to oxidative stress responses is 
      poorly understood. In this article, we addressed this question by using in silico 
      tools. We reviewed the literature for miRNAs whose expression is altered upon 
      oxidative stress damage and used them in combination with various databases and 
      software to predict common gene targets of oxidative stress-modulated miRNAs and 
      affected pathways. Furthermore, we identified miRNAs that simultaneously target 
      the predicted oxidative stress-modulated miRNA gene targets. This generated a 
      list of novel candidate miRNAs potentially involved in oxidative stress 
      responses. By literature search and grouping of pathways and cellular responses, 
      we could classify these candidate miRNAs and their targets into a larger scheme 
      related to oxidative stress responses. To further exemplify the potential of our 
      approach in free radical research, we used our explorative tools in combination 
      with ingenuity pathway analysis to successfully identify new candidate miRNAs 
      involved in the ubiquitination process, a master regulator of cellular responses 
      to oxidative stress and proteostasis. Lastly, we demonstrate that our approach 
      may also be useful to identify novel candidate connections between oxidative 
      stress-related miRNAs and autophagy. In summary, our results indicate novel and 
      important aspects with regard to the integrated biological roles of oxidative 
      stress-modulated miRNAs and demonstrate how this type of in silico approach can 
      be useful as a starting point to generate hypotheses and guide further research 
      on the interrelation between miRNA-based gene regulation, oxidative stress 
      signaling pathways, and autophagy.

TI  - Differential microRNA expression profiles between young and old lung 
      adenocarcinoma patients.
PG  - 892-900
AB  - Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality, and approximately 
      80% of cases are non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Recently, the incidence of 
      NSCLC has been quickly increasing, while the age of patients at diagnosis is 
      decreasing. To date, it is still controversial whether younger patients have 
      better or worse outcomes compared with their older counterparts. MicroRNAs 
      (miRNAs) have been defined to play a key role in cancer pathogenesis, and their 
      aberrant expression has been suggested as a potential biomarker of prognosis in 
      lung adenocarcinoma. To understand the molecular features of young and old 
      adenocarcinoma patients, we investigated the expression level of a panel of 
      miRNAs selected after a mini-literature review. The expression analysis was 
      performed by the nCounter System® (NanoString Technologies) directly on RNA, 
      including small RNAs. The analysis revealed that 7 miRNAs (miR-25-3p, miR-29c-3p, 
      miR-33a-5p, miR-144-3p, miR-153-3p, miR-342-5p and miR-485-3p) were 
      differentially expressed in the two groups (P<0.05). All of these miRNAs showed 
      higher expression levels in young compared to old patients, and their predicted 
      targets included EGFR, MET, VEGF-A, TP53 and PDGFRa. miR-144-3p had an opposite 
      influence on overall survival since its upregulation was associated with a worse 
      prognosis in young patients (P=0.01) and with a better outcome in the older group 
      (P=0.03). We observed that lung cancer in young and old patients may be 
      influenced by different regulatory mechanisms. Moreover, one of the 
      down-regulated miRNAs showed a different prognostic impact in the two groups, 
      confirming that young and old patients deserve a specific clinical approach.

TI  - Roles of NF-κB Signaling in the Regulation of miRNAs Impacting on Inflammation in 
      Cancer.
LID - 10.3390/biomedicines6020040 [doi]
LID - 40
AB  - The NF-κB family of transcription factors regulate the expression of genes 
      encoding proteins and microRNAs (miRNA, miR) precursors that may either 
      positively or negatively regulate a variety of biological processes such as cell 
      cycle progression, cell survival, and cell differentiation. The NF-κB-miRNA 
      transcriptional regulatory network has been implicated in the regulation of 
      proinflammatory, immune, and stress-like responses. Gene regulation by miRNAs has 
      emerged as an additional epigenetic mechanism at the post-transcriptional level. 
      The expression of miRNAs can be regulated by specific transcription factors 
      (TFs), including the NF-κB TF family, and vice versa. The interplay between TFs 
      and miRNAs creates positive or negative feedback loops and also regulatory 
      networks, which can control cell fate. In the current review, we discuss the 
      impact of NF-κB-miRNA interplay and feedback loops and networks impacting on 
      inflammation in cancer. We provide several paradigms of specific NF-κB-miRNA 
      networks that can regulate inflammation linked to cancer. For example, the 
      NF-κB-miR-146 and NF-κB-miR-155 networks fine-tune the activity, intensity, and 
      duration of inflammation, while the NF-κB-miR-21 and NF-κB-miR-181b-1 amplifying 
      loops link inflammation to cancer; and p53- or NF-κB-regulated miRNAs 
      interconnect these pathways and may shift the balance to cancer development or 
      tumor suppression. The availability of genomic data may be useful to verify and 
      find novel interactions, and provide a catalogue of 162 miRNAs targeting and 40 
      miRNAs possibly regulated by NF-κB. We propose that studying active TF-miRNA 
      transcriptional regulatory networks such as NF-κB-miRNA networks in specific 
      cancer types can contribute to our further understanding of the regulatory 
      interplay between inflammation and cancer, and also perhaps lead to the 
      development of pharmacologically novel therapeutic approaches to combat cancer.

TI  - Robust expression of tumor suppressor miRNA's let-7 and miR-195 detected in 
      plasma of Saudi female breast cancer patients.
PG  - 799

AB  - BACKGROUND: Female breast cancer is frequently diagnosed at a later stage and the 
      leading cause of cancer deaths world-wide. Levels of cell-free circulating 
      microRNAs (miRNAs) can potentially be used as biomarkers to measure disease 
      progression in breast cancer patients in a non-invasive way and are therefore of 
      high clinical value. METHODS: Using quantitative RT-PCR, circulating miRNAs were 
      measured in blood samples collected from disease-free individuals (n = 34), 
      triple-negative breast tumours (TNBC) (n = 36) and luminal tumours (n = 57). In 
      addition to intergroup comparisons, plasma miRNA expression levels of all groups 
      were analyzed against RNASeq data from cancerous breast tissue via The Cancer 
      Genome Atlas (TCGA). RESULTS: A differential set of 18 miRNAs were identified in 
      the plasma of breast cancer patients and 10 miRNAs were uniquely identified based 
      on ROC analysis. The most striking findings revealed elevated tumor suppressor 
      let-7 miRNA in luminal breast cancer patients, irrespective of subtype, and 
      elevated miR-195 in plasma of TNBC breast cancer patients. In contrast, 
      hsa-miR-195 and let-7 miRNAs were absent from cancerous TCGA tissue and strongly 
      expressed in surrounding non-tumor tissue indicating that cancerous cells may 
      selectively export tumor suppressor hsa-miR-195 and let-7 miRNAs in order to 
      maintain oncogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: While studies have indicated that the 
      restoration of let-7 and miR-195 may be a potential therapy for cancer, these 
      results suggested that tumor cells may selectively export hsa-miR-195 and let-7 
      miRNAs thereby neutralizing their potential therapeutic effect. However, in order 
      to facilitate earlier detection of breast cancer, blood based screening of 
      hsa-miR-195 and let-7 may be beneficial in a female patient cohort.

AB  - Glioblastomas are among the most lethal cancers; however, recent advances in 
      survival have increased the need for better prognostic markers. microRNAs 
      (miRNAs) hold great prognostic potential being deregulated in glioblastomas and 
      highly stable in stored tissue specimens. Moreover, miRNAs control multiple genes 
      representing an additional level of gene regulation possibly more prognostically 
      powerful than a single gene. The aim of the study was to identify a novel miRNA 
      signature with the ability to separate patients into prognostic subgroups. 
      Samples from 40 glioblastoma patients were included retrospectively; patients 
      were comparable on all clinical aspects except overall survival enabling patients 
      to be categorized as short-term or long-term survivors based on median survival. 
      A miRNome screening was employed, and a prognostic profile was developed using 
      leave-one-out cross-validation. We found that expression patterns of miRNAs; 
      particularly the four miRNAs: hsa-miR-107_st, hsa-miR-548x_st, hsa-miR-3125_st 
      and hsa-miR-331-3p_st could determine short- and long-term survival with a 
      predicted accuracy of 78%. Heatmap dendrograms dichotomized glioblastomas into 
      prognostic subgroups with a significant association to survival in univariate (HR 
      8.50; 95% CI 3.06-23.62; p<0.001) and multivariate analysis (HR 9.84; 95% CI 
      2.93-33.06; p<0.001). Similar tendency was seen in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) 
      using a 2-miRNA signature of miR-107 and miR-331 (miR sum score), which were the 
      only miRNAs available in TCGA. In TCGA, patients with 
      O6-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) unmethylated tumors and low miR sum 
      score had the shortest survival. Adjusting for age and MGMT status, low miR sum 
      score was associated with a poorer prognosis (HR 0.66; 95% CI 0.45-0.97; p = 
      0.033). A Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis predicted the 
      identified miRNAs to regulate genes involved in cell cycle regulation and 
      survival. In conclusion, the biology of miRNAs is complex, but the identified 
      4-miRNA expression pattern could comprise promising biomarkers in glioblastoma 
      stratifying patients into short- and long-term survivors.

TI  - Transcriptomic Profiling of MDA-MB-231 Cells Exposed to Boswellia Serrata and 
      3-O-Acetyl-B-Boswellic Acid; ER/UPR Mediated Programmed Cell Death.
PG  - 409-425
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is characterized by the 
      absence of hormone receptors (estrogen, progesterone and human epidermal growth 
      factor receptor-2) and a relatively poor prognosis due to inefficacy of hormone 
      receptor-based chemotherapies. It is imperative that we continue to explore 
      natural products with potential to impede growth and metastasis of TNBC. In this 
      study, we screened over 1,000 natural products for capacity to induce cell death 
      in TNBC (MDA-MB -231) cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Frankincense (Boswellia 
      serrata extract (BSE)) and 3-O-Acetyl-β-boswellic acid (3-OAβBA) were relatively 
      potent, findings that corroborate the body of existing literature. The effects of 
      BSE and 3-OAβBA on genetic parameters in MDA-MB-231 cells were evaluated by 
      examining whole-transcriptomic influence on mRNAs, long intergenic non-coding RNA 
      transcripts (lincRNA) and non-coding miRNAs. RESULTS: Bio-statistical analysis 
      demarcates the primary effect of both BSE/3-OAβBA on the up-regulation of PERK 
      (protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase)- endoplasmic reticulum 
      (ER)/unfolded protein response (UPR) pathways that are closely tied to activated 
      programmed cell death (APCD). Global profiling confirms concomitant effects of 
      BSE/3-OAβBA on upwardly expressed ER/URP APCD key components PERK (EIF2AK3), 
      XBP1, C/EBP homologous protein transcription factor (CHOP), ATF3 and 
      DDIT3,4/DNA-damage-inducible transcript 3,4 (GADD34). Further, BSE and/or 3-OAβBA 
      significantly down-regulated oncogenes (OG) which, heretofore, lack functional 
      pathway mapping, but are capable of driving epithelial-mesenchymal transition 
      (EMT), cell survival, proliferation, metastasis and drug resistance. Among these 
      are cell migration-inducing protein hyaluronan binding (CEMIP) [-7.22]; 
      transglutaminase 2 [-4.96], SRY box 9 (SOX9) [-4.09], inhibitor of DNA binding 1, 
      dominant negative helix-loop-helix protein (ID1) [-6.56]; and endothelin 1 (EDN1, 
      [-5.06]). Likewise, in the opposite manner, BSE and/or 3-OAβBA induced the robust 
      overexpression of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs), including: glutathione-depleting 
      ChaC glutathione-specific gamma-glutamylcyclotransferase 1 (CHAC1) [+21.67]; the 
      mTOR inhibitors - sestrin 2 (SESN2) [+16.4] Tribbles homolog 3 (TRIB3) [+6.2], 
      homocysteine-inducible, endoplasmic reticulum stress-inducible, ubiquitin-like 
      domain member 1 (HERPUD1) [+12.01]; and cystathionine gamma-lyase (CTH) [+11.12]. 
      CONCLUSION: The anti-cancer effects of the historically used frankincense sap 
      (BSE) appear to involve major impact on the ER/UPR response, concomitant to 
      effecting multiple targets counter to the growth, proliferation and metastasis of 
      TNBC cancer cells. The microarray data are available at Expression Omnibus GEO 
      Series accession number GSE102891.

TI  - Exosomes containing differential expression of microRNA and mRNA in osteosarcoma 
      that can predict response to chemotherapy.
PG  - 75968-75978
LID - 10.18632/oncotarget.18373 [doi]
AB  - A major challenge in osteosarcoma (OS) is the selection of the most effective 
      chemotherapeutic agents for individual patients, while the administration of 
      ineffective chemotherapy increases mortality and decreases quality of life in 
      patients. This emphasizes the need to evaluate every patient's probability of 
      responding to each chemotherapeutic agent. We developed a profiling strategy for 
      serum exosomal microRNAs and mRNAs in OS patients with differential 
      chemotherapeutic responses. Twelve miRNAs were up regulated and 18 miRNAs were 
      under regulated significantly in OS patient with poor chemotherapeutic response 
      when compared with those in good chemotherapeutic response (p<0.05). In addition, 
      miR-124, miR133a, miR-199a-3p, and miR-385 were validated and significantly 
      reduced in poorly responded patients with an independent OS cohort. While 
      miR-135b, miR-148a, miR-27a, and miR-9 were significantly over expressed in serum 
      exosomes. Bioinformatic analysis by DIANA-mirPath demonstrated that Proteoglycans 
      in cancer, Hippo signaling pathway, Pathways in cancer, Transcriptional 
      misregulation in cancer, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, Ras signaling pathway, 
      Ubiquitin mediated proteolysis, Choline metabolism in cancer were the most 
      prominent pathways enriched in quantiles with the miRNA patterns related to poor 
      chemotherapeutic response. Messenger RNAs(mRNAs) includingAnnexin2, Smad2, 
      Methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP), Cdc42-interacting protein 4 (CIP4), 
      Pigment Epithelium-Derived Factor (PEDF), WW domain-containing oxidoreductase 
      (WWOX), Cell division cycle 5-like (Cdc5L), P27 were differentially expressed in 
      exosomes in OS patients with different chemotherapeutic response. These data 
      demonstrated that exosomal RNA molecules are reliable biomarkers in classifying 
      osteosarcoma with different chemotherapy sensitivity.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To validate previously discovered miRNAs (miR-31-5p and miR-149-5p) as 
      prognostic factors for UTUC in an independent cohort of UTUC patients. PATIENTS 
      AND METHODS: Multicenter, international and retrospective study of formalin-fixed 
      paraffin-embedded tissue samples from 103 UTUC patients (45 progressing and 58 
      non-progressing) who underwent radical nephroureterectomy. Total RNA was isolated 
      and reverse transcribed. The expression of target miRNAs (miR-31-5p and 
      miR-149-5p) and the endogenous control miR-218-5p was evaluated in all samples by 
      reverse transcription quantitative PCR. Normalized miRNA expression values were 
      evaluated by multivariate forward stepwise Cox regression analysis. Kaplan Meier 
      curves were used to discriminate between two groups of patients with a different 
      probability of tumour progression. RESULTS: The mean age (range) of the series 
      was 67 (33-94) years. Overall, 45 patients (43.7%) developed tumour progression 
      and 32 patients (31.2%) died, 20 of these (62.5%) due to their UTUC, after a 
      median follow-up of 36 months. The mean time for tumour progression and 
      cancer-specific survival were 15 and 20 months, respectively. Five year tumour 
      progression free survival and cancer-specific survival were 58% for ≤ pT2, 36% 
      for pT3 and 0% for pT4 and 67.8% for ≤ pT2, 50.6% for pT3 and 0% for pT4, 
      respectively. In the multivariate analysis, expression of miR-31-5p was found to 
      be an independent prognostic factor of tumour progression (HR 1.1; 95% CI 
      1.039-1.273; p=0.02). Kaplan Meier curve shows that miR-31-5p expression values 
      are able to discriminate between two groups of UTUC patients with a different 
      probability of tumour progression (p=0.007). CONCLUSIONS: We have been able to 
      validate our previous results in an independent multicentre international cohort 
      of UTUC patients, suggesting that miRNA-31-5p could be a useful prognostic marker 
      of UTUC progression. The application of miRNA expression values to clinical 
      practice could refine the currently used clinicopathological-based approach for 
      predicting UTUC patients' outcome.

TI  - miRnalyze: an interactive database linking tool to unlock intuitive microRNA 
      regulation of cell signaling pathways.

AB  - The various pathophysiological processes occurring in living systems are known to 
      be orchestrated by delicate interplays and cross-talks between different genes 
      and their regulators. Among the various regulators of genes, there is a class of 
      small non-coding RNA molecules known as microRNAs. Although, the relative 
      simplicity of miRNAs and their ability to modulate cellular processes make them 
      attractive therapeutic candidates, their presence in large numbers make it 
      challenging for experimental researchers to interpret the intricacies of the 
      molecular processes they regulate. Most of the existing bioinformatic tools fail 
      to address these challenges. Here, we present a new web resource 'miRnalyze' that 
      has been specifically designed to directly identify the putative regulation of 
      cell signaling pathways by miRNAs. The tool integrates miRNA-target predictions 
      with signaling cascade members by utilizing TargetScanHuman 7.1 miRNA-target 
      prediction tool and the KEGG pathway database, and thus provides researchers with 
      in-depth insights into modulation of signal transduction pathways by miRNAs. 
      miRnalyze is capable of identifying common miRNAs targeting more than one gene in 
      the same signaling pathway-a feature that further increases the probability of 
      modulating the pathway and downstream reactions when using miRNA modulators. 
      Additionally, miRnalyze can sort miRNAs according to the seed-match types and 
      TargetScan Context ++ score, thus providing a hierarchical list of most valuable 
      miRNAs. Furthermore, in order to provide users with comprehensive information 
      regarding miRNAs, genes and pathways, miRnalyze also links to expression data of 
      miRNAs (miRmine) and genes (TiGER) and proteome abundance (PaxDb) data. To 
      validate the capability of the tool, we have documented the correlation of 
      miRnalyze's prediction with experimental confirmation studies. DATABASE URL:

TI  - Chronic pistachio intake modulates circulating microRNAs related to glucose 
      metabolism and insulin resistance in prediabetic subjects.
PG  - 2181-2191
LID - 10.1007/s00394-016-1262-5 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the effects of a pistachio-enriched diet on the profile of 
      circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) related to glucose metabolism and insulin 
      resistance (IR). METHODS: Randomized crossover clinical trial in 49 subjects with 
      prediabetes was performed. Subjects consumed a pistachio-supplemented diet (PD, 
      50 % carbohydrates, 33 % fat, including 57 g/day of pistachios) and an isocaloric 
      control diet (CD, 55 % carbohydrates and 30 % fat) for 4 months each, separated 
      by a 2-week washout period. The plasma profile of a set of seven predefined 
      miRNAs related to glucose and insulin metabolism was analyzed by quantitative 
      RT-PCR. RESULTS: After the PD period, subjects have shown significant lower 
      circulating levels of miR-192 and miR-375 compared to CD period, whereas miR-21 
      nonsignificantly increased after PD compared with CD (47 vs. 2 %, P = 0.092). 
      Interestingly, changes in circulating miR-192 and miR-375 were positively 
      correlated with plasma glucose, insulin and HOMA-IR. CONCLUSION: Chronic 
      pistachio consumption positively modulates the expression of some miRNA 
      previously implicated on insulin sensitivity.
