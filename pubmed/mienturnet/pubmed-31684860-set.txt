AB  - BACKGROUND: miRNAs regulate the expression of several genes with one miRNA able 
      to target multiple genes and with one gene able to be simultaneously targeted by 
      more than one miRNA. Therefore, it has become indispensable to shorten the long 
      list of miRNA-target interactions to put in the spotlight in order to gain 
      insight into understanding the regulatory mechanism orchestrated by miRNAs in 
      various cellular processes. A reasonable solution is certainly to prioritize 
      miRNA-target interactions to maximize the effectiveness of the downstream 
      analysis. RESULTS: We propose a new and easy-to-use web tool MIENTURNET (MicroRNA 
      ENrichment TURned NETwork) that receives in input a list of miRNAs or mRNAs and 
      tackles the problem of prioritizing miRNA-target interactions by performing a 
      statistical analysis followed by a fully featured network-based visualization and 
      analysis. The statistics is used to assess the significance of an 
      over-representation of miRNA-target interactions and then MIENTURNET filters 
      based on the statistical significance associated with each miRNA-target 
      interaction. In addition, the holistic approach of the network theory is used to 
      infer possible evidences of miRNA regulation by capturing emergent properties of 
      the miRNA-target regulatory network that would be not evident through a pairwise 
      analysis of the individual components. CONCLUSION: MIENTURNET offers the 
      possibility to consistently perform both statistical and network-based analyses 
      by using only a single tool leading to a more effective prioritization of the 
      miRNA-target interactions. This has the potential to avoid researchers without 
      computational and informatics skills to navigate multiple websites and thus to 
      independently investigate miRNA activity in every cellular process of interest in 
      an easy and at the same time exhaustive way thanks to the intuitive web 
      interface. The web application along with a well-documented and comprehensive 
      user guide are freely available at 
      http://userver.bio.uniroma1.it/apps/mienturnet/ without any login requirement.

TI  - Potential of miRNAs in Plasma Extracellular Vesicle for the Stratification of 
      Prostate Cancer in a South African Population.
LID - 10.3390/cancers15153968 [doi]
LID - 3968
AB  - Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common cause of cancer death among African men. 
      The analysis of microRNAs (miRNAs) in plasma extracellular vesicles (EVs) can be 
      utilized as a non-invasive tool for the diagnosis of PCa. In this study, we used 
      small RNA sequencing to profile miRNAs cargo in plasma EVs from South African PCa 
      patients. We evaluated the differential expression of miRNAs between low and high 
      Gleason scores in the plasma EVs of South African patients and in the prostatic 
      tissue from data available in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Data Portal. We 
      identified 7 miRNAs differently expressed in both EVs and prostatic tissues. We 
      evaluated their expression using qPCR in a larger cohort of 10 patients with 
      benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and 24 patients with PCa. Here, we reported 
      that the ratio between two of these miRNAs (i.e., miR-194-5p/miR-16-5p) showed a 
      higher concentration in PCa compared to BPH and in metastatic PCa compared to 
      localized PCa. We explored for the first time the profiling of miRNAs cargo in 
      plasma EVs as a tool for the identification of putative markers in the South 
      African population. Our finding indicated the ratio miR-194-5p/miR-16-5p as a 
      non-invasive marker for the evaluation of PCa aggressiveness in this population.

TI  - Plasma microRNA ratios associated with breast cancer detection in a nested 
      case-control study from a mammography screening cohort.

AB  - Mammographic breast cancer screening is effective in reducing breast cancer 
      mortality. Nevertheless, several limitations are known. Therefore, developing an 
      alternative or complementary non-invasive tool capable of increasing the accuracy 
      of the screening process is highly desirable. The objective of this study was to 
      identify circulating microRNA (miRs) ratios associated with BC in women attending 
      mammography screening. A nested case-control study was conducted within the 
      ANDROMEDA cohort (women of age 46-67 attending BC screening). Pre-diagnostic 
      plasma samples, information on life-styles and common BC risk factors were 
      collected. Small-RNA sequencing was carried out on plasma samples from 65 cases 
      and 66 controls. miR¬†ratios associated with BC were selected by two-sample 
      Wilcoxon test and lasso logistic regression. Subsequent assessment by RT-qPCR of 
      the miRs contained in the selected miR¬†ratios was carried out as a platform 
      validation. To identify the most promising biomarkers,¬†penalised logistic 
      regression was further applied to candidate miR¬†ratios alone, or in combination 
      with non-molecular factors. Small-RNA sequencing yielded 20 candidate miR¬†ratios 
      associated with BC, which were further assessed by RT-qPCR. In the resulting 
      model, penalised logistic regression selected seven miR¬†ratios 
      (miR-199a-3p_let-7a-5p, miR-26b-5p_miR-142-5p, let-7b-5p_miR-19b-3p, 
      miR-101-3p_miR-19b-3p, miR-93-5p_miR-19b-3p, let-7a-5p_miR-22-3p and 
      miR-21-5p_miR-23a-3p), together with body mass index (BMI), menopausal status 
      (MS), the interaction term BMI‚Äâ*‚ÄâMS, life-style score and breast density. The ROC 
      AUC of the model was 0.79 with a sensitivity and specificity of 71.9% and 76.6%, 
      respectively. We identified biomarkers potentially useful for BC screening 
      measured through a widespread and low-cost technique. This is the first study 
      reporting circulating miRs for BC detection in a screening setting. Validation in 
      a wider sample is warranted.Trial registration: The Andromeda prospective cohort 
      study protocol was retrospectively registered on 27-11-2015 (NCT02618538).

TI  - Evaluation of the Possible Pathways Involved in the Protective Effects of 
      Quercetin, Naringenin, and Rutin at the Gene, Protein and miRNA Levels Using 
      In-Silico Multidimensional Data Analysis.

AB  - Flavonoids are secondary metabolites that are non-essential for plant growth or 
      survival, and they also provide numerous health benefits to humans. They are 
      antioxidants that shield plants from the ill effects of ultraviolet light, pests, 
      and diseases. They are beneficial to health for several reasons, including 
      lowering inflammation, boosting cardiovascular health, and lowering cancer risk. 
      This study looked into the physicochemical features of these substances to 
      determine the potential pharmacological pathways involved in their protective 
      actions. Potential targets responsible for the protective effects of quercetin, 
      naringenin, and rutin were identified with SwissADME. The associated biological 
      processes and protein-protein networks were analyzed by using the GeneMANIA, 
      Metascape, and STRING servers. All the flavonoids were predicted to be orally 
      bioavailable, with more than 90% targets as enzymes, including kinases and 
      lyases, and with common targets such as NOS2, CASP3, CASP9, CAT, BCL2, TNF, and 
      HMOX1. TNF was shown to be a major target in over 250 interactions. To extract 
      the "biological meanings" from the MCODE networks' constituent parts, a GO 
      enrichment analysis was performed on each one. The most important transcription 
      factors in gene regulation were RELA, NFKB1, PPARG, and SP1. Treatment with 
      quercetin, naringenin, or rutin increased the expression and interaction of the 
      microRNAs' hsa-miR-34a-5p, hsa-miR-30b-5p, hsa-let-7a-5p, and hsa-miR-26a-1-3p. 
      The anticancer effects of hsa-miR-34a-5p have been experimentally confirmed. It 
      also plays a critical role in controlling other cancer-related processes such as 
      cell proliferation, apoptosis, EMT, and metastasis. This study's findings might 
      lead to a deeper comprehension of the mechanisms responsible for flavonoids' 
      protective effects and could present new avenues for exploration.

TI  - Circulating miRNAs Expression in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue 
      Syndrome.
LID - 10.3390/ijms241310582 [doi]
LID - 10582
AB  - Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a complex 
      multifactorial disease that causes increasing morbidity worldwide, and many 
      individuals with ME/CFS symptoms remain undiagnosed due to the lack of diagnostic 
      biomarkers. Its etiology is still unknown, but increasing evidence supports a 
      role of herpesviruses (including HHV-6A and HHV-6B) as potential triggers. 
      Interestingly, the infection by these viruses has been reported to impact the 
      expression of microRNAs (miRNAs), short non-coding RNA sequences which have been 
      suggested to be epigenetic factors modulating ME/CFS pathogenic mechanisms. 
      Notably, the presence of circulating miRNAs in plasma has raised the possibility 
      to use them as valuable biomarkers for distinguishing ME/CFS patients from 
      healthy controls. Thus, this study aimed at determining the role of eight miRNAs, 
      which were selected for their previous association with ME/CFS, as potential 
      circulating biomarkers of the disease. Their presence was quantitatively 
      evaluated in plasma from 40 ME/CFS patients and 20 healthy controls by specific 
      Taqman assays, and the results showed that six out of the eight of the selected 
      miRNAs were differently expressed in patients compared to controls; more 
      specifically, five miRNAs were significantly upregulated (miR-127-3p, miR-142-5p, 
      miR-143-3p, miR-150-5p, and miR-448), and one was downmodulated (miR-140-5p). 
      MiRNA levels directly correlated with disease severity, whereas no significant 
      correlations were observed with the plasma levels of seven pro-inflammatory 
      cytokines or with the presence/load of HHV-6A/6B genome, as judged by specific 
      PCR amplification. The results may open the way for further validation of miRNAs 
      as new potential biomarkers in ME/CFS and increase the knowledge of the complex 
      pathways involved in the ME/CFS development.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The ovarian follicle consists of the oocyte, somatic cells, and 
      follicular fluid (FF). Proper signalling between these compartments is required 
      for optimal folliculogenesis. The association between polycystic ovarian syndrome 
      (PCOS) and extracellular vesicular small non-coding RNAs (snRNAs) signatures in 
      follicular fluid (FF) and how this relates to adiposity is unknown. The purpose 
      of this study was to determine whether FF extracellular vesicle (FFEV)-derived 
      snRNAs are differentially expressed (DE) between PCOS and non-PCOS subjects; and 
      if these differences are vesicle-specific and/or adiposity-dependent. METHODS: FF 
      and granulosa cells (GC) were collected from 35 patients matched by demographic 
      and stimulation parameters. FFEVs were isolated and snRNA libraries were 
      constructed, sequenced, and analyzed. RESULTS: miRNAs were the most abundant 
      biotype present, with specific enrichment in exosomes (EX), whereas in GCs long 
      non-coding RNAs were the most abundant biotype. In obese PCOS vs. lean PCOS, 
      pathway analysis revealed target genes involved in cell survival and apoptosis, 
      leukocyte differentiation and migration, JAK/STAT, and MAPK signalling. In obese 
      PCOS FFEVs were selectively enriched (FFEVs vs. GCs) for miRNAs targeting p53 
      signalling, cell survival and apoptosis, FOXO, Hippo, TNF, and MAPK signalling. 
      DISCUSSION: We provide comprehensive profiling of snRNAs in FFEVs and GCs of PCOS 
      and non-PCOS patients, highlighting the effect of adiposity on these findings. We 
      hypothesize that the selective packaging and release of miRNAs specifically 
      targeting anti-apoptotic genes into the FF may be an attempt by the follicle to 
      reduce the apoptotic pressure of the GCs and stave off premature apoptosis of the 
      follicle observed in PCOS.

AB  - Extrachromosomal circular DNAs (eccDNAs) carrying random genomic segments are 
      broadly found across different cancer types, but their molecular functions and 
      impact in gastric cancer (GC) are rarely known. In this study, we aimed to 
      investigate the potential role of eccDNA in GC. Using the Circle-seq strategy, we 
      observed the eccDNA abundance in gastric cancer tissues (GCT) was aberrantly 
      higher than that of normal adjacent tissues (NAT). The high abundance of eccDNAs 
      carrying oncogene-segments in GCT may represent the DNA damage products of 
      amplified oncogenes. Analysis of GCT over-represented eccDNA carrying enhancer 
      (eccEnhancer) based on data from FANTOM5 project combined with TCGA database 
      suggested the GC over-represented eccEnhancers may contribute to development of 
      GC. GC over-represented eccDNAs carrying pre-miRNA (eccMIR) were enriched to 
      multiple cancer-relevant signal pathways by KEGG analysis. We then synthesized 
      the top six GC over-represented eccMIRs and found four of them enabled high 
      expression of miRNAs and down-regulation of miRNA-target genes in MGC803 cells. 
      Furthermore, we observed the inheritance of GC over-represented eccMIRs benefited 
      host cell proliferation and promoted the aggressive features of host cells. 
      Altogether, this study revealed the GC over-represented eccDNAs carrying 
      functional genomic segments were related to the carcinogenesis of GC and 
      presented the capability to facilitate cancer progression, suggesting the 
      cancerous eccDNAs may serve as a dynamic reservoir for genome plasticity and 
      rapid adaptive evolution of cancer. Therefore, blocking the pathways for eccDNAs 
      generation may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of gastric 
      cancer.

TI  - Leucocyte-derived micro-RNAs as candidate biomarkers in Brugada syndrome.
LID - 10.1093/europace/euad145 [doi]
LID - euad145
AB  - AIMS: Risk stratification for sudden cardiac death in patients with Brugada 
      syndrome remains a major challenge. Contemporary risk prediction models have only 
      modest predictive value. The aim of this study was to assess the role of 
      micro-RNAs from peripheral blood as candidate biomarkers in Brugada syndrome. 
      METHODS AND RESULTS: In this prospective study, Brugada patients and unaffected 
      control individuals were enrolled for analysis of leucocyte-derived microRNAs 
      (miRNAs) levels. Expression levels of 798 different circulating miRNAs were 
      analysed on the NanoString¬Æ nCounter platform. All results were cross-validated 
      by using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Micro-RNA expression levels of 
      Brugada patients were compared with clinical data. A total of 21 definite Brugada 
      patients (38% with a history of ventricular arrhythmia or cardiac arrest) and 30 
      unaffected control individuals were included in the study. Micro-RNA analysis 
      showed a distinct expression profile in Brugada patients with 42 differentially 
      expressed markers (38 up-regulated, 4 down-regulated miRNAs). The symptom status 
      of Brugada patients was associated with a distinct miRNA signature. Micro-RNAs 
      145-5p and 585-3p were significantly up-regulated in symptomatic Brugada patients 
      (P = 0.04). Incorporating miRNAs 145-5p and 585-3p into a multivariable model 
      demonstrated significantly increased symptom prediction (area under the curve = 
      0.96; 95% confidence interval: 0.88-1.00). CONCLUSION: Brugada patients display a 
      distinct miRNA expression profile compared with unaffected control individuals. 
      There is also evidence that certain miRNAs (miR-145-5p and miR-585-3p) are 
      associated with the symptom status of Brugada patients. The results suggest the 
      principal utility of leucocyte-derived miRNAs as prognostic biomarkers for 
      Brugada syndrome.

AB  - The postmortem interval (PMI) is the time elapsing since the death of an 
      individual until the body is examined. Different molecules have been analyzed to 
      better estimate the PMI with variable results. The miRNAs draw attention in the 
      forensic field to estimate the PMI as they can better support degradation. In the 
      present work, we analyzed the miRNome at early PMI in rats' skeletal muscle using 
      the Affymetrix GeneChip‚Ñ¢ miRNA 4.0 microarrays. We found 156 dysregulated miRNAs 
      in rats' skeletal muscle at 24 h of PMI, out of which 84 were downregulated, and 
      72 upregulated. The miRNA most significantly downregulated was miR-139-5p (FC = 
      -160, p = 9.97 √ó 10(-11)), while the most upregulated was rno-miR-92b-5p (FC = 
      241.18, p = 2.39 √ó 10(-6)). Regarding the targets of these dysregulated miRNAs, 
      the rno-miR-125b-5p and rno-miR-138-5p were the miRNAs with more mRNA targets. 
      The mRNA targets that we found in the present study participate in several 
      biological processes such as interleukin secretion regulation, translation 
      regulation, cell growth, or low oxygen response. In addition, we found a 
      downregulation of SIRT1 mRNA and an upregulation of TGFBR2 mRNA at 24 h of PMI. 
      These results suggest there is an active participation of miRNAs at early PMI 
      which could be further explored to identify potential biomarkers for PMI 
      estimation.

TI  - DIANA-miRPath v4.0: expanding target-based miRNA functional analysis in cell-type 
      and tissue contexts.
PG  - W154-W159
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkad431 [doi]
AB  - DIANA-miRPath is an online miRNA analysis platform harnessing predicted or 
      experimentally supported miRNA interactions towards the exploration of combined 
      miRNA effects. In its latest version (v4.0, http://www.microrna.gr/miRPathv4), 
      DIANA-miRPath breaks new ground by introducing the capacity to tailor its 
      target-based miRNA functional analysis engine to specific biological and/or 
      experimental contexts. Via a redesigned modular interface with rich interaction, 
      annotation and parameterization options, users can now perform enrichment 
      analysis on Gene Ontology (GO) terms, KEGG and REACTOME pathways, sets from 
      Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) and PFAM. Included miRNA interaction sets 
      are derived from state-of-the-art resources of experimentally supported 
      (DIANA-TarBase v8.0, miRTarBase and microCLIP cell-type-specific interactions) or 
      from in silico miRNA-target interactions (updated DIANA-microT-CDS and TargetScan 
      predictions). Bulk and single-cell expression datasets from The Cancer Genome 
      Atlas (TCGA), the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx) and adult/fetal 
      single-cell atlases are integrated and can be used to assess the expression of 
      enriched term components across a wide range of states. A discrete module 
      enabling enrichment analyses using CRISPR knock-out screen datasets enables the 
      detection of selected miRNAs with potentially crucial roles within conditions 
      under study. Notably, the option to upload custom interaction, term, 
      expression¬†and screen sets further expands the versatility of miRPath webserver.

TI  - Alterations of miRNA Expression in Diffuse Hyperplastic Perilobar 
      Nephroblastomatosis: Mapping the Way to Understanding Wilms' Tumor Development 
      and Differential Diagnosis.
LID - 10.3390/ijms24108793 [doi]
LID - 8793
AB  - Wilms' tumor (WT) is the most common renal malignancy in children. In diffuse 
      hyperplastic perilobar nephroblastomatosis (DHPLN), nephrogenic rests result in a 
      bulky enlargement of the kidney, a condition considered as a premalignant state 
      before WT. Despite relevant clinical differences between WT and DHPLN, they are 
      often challenging to distinguish based on histology. Molecular markers would 
      improve differential diagnosis, but none are available at present. In our study, 
      we investigated the potential of microRNAs (miRNAs) as such biomarkers, also 
      aiming to shed light on the chronological order of expression changes. 
      Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples from four DHPLN cases and 
      adjacent healthy tissues were tested using a PCR array containing primers for 84 
      miRNAs implicated in genitourinary cancer. Expression in DHPLN was compared to WT 
      data available in dbDEMC. Let-7, miR-135, miR-146a-5p, miR-182-5p, miR-183-5p, 
      miR-20b-3p, miR-29b-3p, miR-195-5p and miR-17-5p showed potential to be used as 
      biomarkers to distinguish WT and DHPLN in cases when traditional differential 
      diagnosis is inconclusive. Our study also revealed miRNAs which may play a role 
      in the initial steps of the pathogenesis (at a precancerous stage) and ones which 
      become deregulated later in WT. More experiments are needed to confirm our 
      observations and find new candidate markers.

TI  - Paternal Western diet causes transgenerational increase in food consumption in 
      Drosophila with parallel alterations in the offspring brain proteome and 
      microRNAs.
PG  - e22966
LID - 10.1096/fj.202300239RR [doi]
AB  - Several lines of evidence indicate that ancestral diet might play an important 
      role in determining offspring's metabolic traits. However, it is not yet clear 
      whether ancestral diet can affect offspring's food choices and feeding behavior. 
      In the current study, taking advantage of Drosophila model system, we demonstrate 
      that paternal Western diet (WD) increases offspring food consumption up to the 
      fourth generation. Paternal WD also induced alterations in F1 offspring brain 
      proteome. Using enrichment analyses of pathways for upregulated and downregulated 
      proteins, we found that upregulated proteins had significant enrichments in terms 
      related to translation and translation factors, whereas downregulated proteins 
      displayed enrichments in small molecule metabolic processes, TCA cycles, and 
      electron transport chain (ETC). Using MIENTURNET miRNA prediction tool, 
      dme-miR-10-3p was identified as the top conserved miRNA predicted to target 
      proteins regulated by ancestral diet. RNAi-based knockdown of miR-10 in the brain 
      significantly increased food consumption, implicating miR-10 as a potential 
      factor in programming feeding behavior. Together, these findings suggest that 
      ancestral nutrition may influence offspring feeding behavior through alterations 
      in miRNAs.

AB  - Exosomes are tiny vesicles released by cells that carry communications to local 
      and distant locations. Emerging research has revealed the role played by 
      integrins found on the surface of exosomes in delivering information once they 
      reach their destination. But until now, little has been known on the initial 
      upstream steps of the migration process. Using biochemical and imaging 
      approaches, we show here that exosomes isolated from both leukemic and healthy 
      hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells can navigate their way from the cell of 
      origin due to the presence of sialyl Lewis X modifications surface glycoproteins. 
      This, in turn, allows binding to E-selectin at distant sites so the exosomes can 
      deliver their messages. We show that when leukemic exosomes were injected into 
      NSG mice, they traveled to the spleen and spine, sites typical of leukemic cell 
      engraftment. This process, however, was inhibited in mice pre-treated with 
      blocking E-selectin antibodies. Significantly, our proteomic analysis found that 
      among the proteins contained within exosomes are signaling proteins, suggesting 
      that exosomes are trying to deliver active cues to recipient cells that 
      potentially alter their physiology. Intriguingly, the work outlined here also 
      suggests that protein cargo can dynamically change upon exosome binding to 
      receptors such as E-selectin, which thereby could alter the impact it has to 
      regulate the physiology of the recipient cells. Furthermore, as an example of how 
      miRNAs contained in exosomes can influence RNA expression in recipient cells, our 
      analysis showed that miRNAs found in KG1a-derived exosomes target tumor 
      suppressing proteins such as PTEN.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has different etiologies that 
      contribute to its heterogeneity. In regards to the number of HCC patients, Egypt 
      ranks third in Africa and fifteenth worldwide. Despite significant advancements 
      in HCC diagnosis and treatment, the precise biology of the tumor is still not 
      fully understood, which has a negative impact on patient outcomes. METHODS: 
      Advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) have increased our knowledge of the 
      molecular complexity of HCC. RESULTS & DISCUSSION: In this research, 16 HCC and 6 
      tumor adjacent tissues (control) of Child A Egyptian patients were successfully 
      profiled for the expression profile of miRNAs by NGS. Forty-one differentially 
      expressed miRNAs (DEMs) were found by differential expression analysis, with 31 
      being upregulated and 10 being downregulated. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and 
      Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis was then conducted on these 
      differentially expressed miRNAs revealing that Sensitivity and specificity 
      analysis showed that hsa-miR-4488, hsa-miR-3178, and hsa-miR-3182 were unique 
      miRNAs as they are expressed in HCC tissues only. These miRNAs were all highly 
      involved in AMPK signaling pathways. However, hsa-miR-214-3p was expressed in 
      control tissues about eight times higher than in cancer tissues and was most 
      abundant in "pathways in cancer and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway" KEGG terms. As 
      promising HCC diagnostic markers, we here suggest hsa-miR-4488, hsa-miR-3178, 
      hsa-miR-3182, and hsa-miR-214-3p. We further urge future research to confirm 
      these markers' diagnostic and prognostic potential as well as their roles in the 
      pathophysiology of HCC.

AB  - Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) latency in CD34+ progenitor cells is the outcome of 
      a complex and continued interaction of virus and host that is initiated during 
      very early stages of infection and reflects pro- and anti-viral activity. We 
      hypothesized that a key event during early infection could involve changes to 
      host miRNAs, allowing for rapid modulation of the host proteome. Here, we 
      identify 72 significantly upregulated miRNAs and three that were downregulated by 
      6hpi of infection of CD34+ cells which were then subject to multiple in silico 
      analyses to identify potential genes and pathways important for viral infection. 
      The analyses focused on the upregulated miRNAs and were used to predict potential 
      gene hubs or common mRNA targets of multiple miRNAs. Constitutive deletion of one 
      target, the transcriptional regulator JDP2, resulted in a defect in latent 
      infection of myeloid cells; interestingly, transient knockdown in differentiated 
      dendritic cells resulted in increased viral lytic IE gene expression, arguing for 
      subtle differences in the role of JDP2 during latency establishment and 
      reactivation of HCMV. Finally, in silico predictions identified clusters of genes 
      with related functions (such as calcium signaling, ubiquitination, and chromatin 
      modification), suggesting potential importance in latency and reactivation. 
      Consistent with this hypothesis, we demonstrate that viral IE gene expression is 
      sensitive to calcium channel inhibition in reactivating dendritic cells. In 
      conclusion, we demonstrate HCMV alters the miRNAome rapidly upon infection and 
      that in silico interrogation of these changes reveals new insight into mechanisms 
      controlling viral gene expression during HCMV latency and, intriguingly, 
      reactivation.

AB  - Genes mutated in monogenic neurodevelopmental disorders are broadly expressed. 
      This observation supports the concept that monogenic neurodevelopmental disorders 
      are systemic diseases that profoundly impact neurodevelopment. We tested the 
      systemic disease model focusing on Rett syndrome, which is caused by mutations in 
      MECP2 . Transcriptomes and proteomes of organs and brain regions from Mecp2 -null 
      mice as well as diverse MECP2 -null human cells were assessed. Widespread changes 
      in the steady-state transcriptome and proteome were identified in brain regions 
      and organs of presymptomatic Mecp2 -null male mice as well as mutant human cell 
      lines. The extent of these transcriptome and proteome modifications was similar 
      in cortex, liver, kidney, and skeletal muscle and more pronounced than in the 
      hippocampus and striatum. In particular, Mecp2 - and MECP2 -sensitive proteomes 
      were enriched in synaptic and metabolic annotated gene products, the latter 
      encompassing lipid metabolism and mitochondrial pathways. MECP2 mutations altered 
      pyruvate-dependent mitochondrial respiration while maintaining the capacity to 
      use glutamine as a mitochondrial carbon source. We conclude that mutations in 
      Mecp2 / MECP2 perturb lipid and mitochondrial metabolism systemically limiting 
      cellular flexibility to utilize mitochondrial fuels.

TI  - Alterations in Abundance and Compartmentalization of miRNAs in Blood Plasma 
      Extracellular Vesicles and Extracellular Condensates during HIV/SIV Infection and 
      Its Modulation by Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) and Delta-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol 
      (Œî(9)-THC).

AB  - In this follow-up study, we investigated the abundance and compartmentalization 
      of blood plasma extracellular miRNA (exmiRNA) into lipid-based carriers-blood 
      plasma extracellular vesicles (EVs) and non-lipid-based carriers-extracellular 
      condensates (ECs) during SIV infection. We also assessed how combination 
      antiretroviral therapy (cART), administered in conjunction with phytocannabinoid 
      delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), altered the abundance and 
      compartmentalization of exmiRNAs in the EVs and ECs of SIV-infected rhesus 
      macaques (RMs). Unlike cellular miRNAs, exmiRNAs in blood plasma may serve as 
      minimally invasive disease indicators because they are readily detected in stable 
      forms. The stability of exmiRNAs in cell culture fluids and body fluids (urine, 
      saliva, tears, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), semen, blood) is based on their 
      association with different carriers (lipoproteins, EVs, and ECs) that protect 
      them from the activities of endogenous RNases. Here, we showed that in the blood 
      plasma of uninfected control RMs, significantly less exmiRNAs were associated 
      with EVs compared to the level (30% higher) associated with ECs, and that SIV 
      infection altered the profile of EVs and ECs miRNAome (Manuscript 1). In people 
      living with HIV (PLWH), host-encoded miRNAs regulate both host and viral gene 
      expression, which may serve as indicators of disease or treatment biomarkers. The 
      profile of miRNAs in blood plasma of PLWH (elite controllers versus viremic 
      patients) are different, indicating that HIV may alter host miRNAome. However, 
      there are no studies assessing the effect of cART or other substances used by 
      PLWH, such as THC, on the abundance of exmiRNA and their association with EVs and 
      ECs. Moreover, longitudinal exmiRNA profiles following SIV infection, treatment 
      with THC, cART, or THC+cART remains unclear. Here, we serially analyzed miRNAs 
      associated with blood plasma derived EVs and ECs. Methods: Paired EVs and ECs 
      were separated from EDTA blood plasma of male Indian rhesus macaques (RMs) in 
      five treatment groups, including VEH/SIV, VEH/SIV/cART, THC/SIV, THC/SIV/cART, or 
      THC alone. Separation of EVs and ECs was achieved with the unparalleled 
      nano-particle purification tool ‚îÄPPLC, a state-of-the-art, innovative technology 
      equipped with gradient agarose bead sizes and a fast fraction collector that 
      allows high resolution separation and retrieval of preparative quantities of 
      sub-populations of extracellular structures. Global miRNA profiles of the paired 
      EVs and ECs were determined with RealSeq Biosciences (Santa Cruz, CA) custom 
      sequencing platform by conducting small RNA (sRNA)-seq. The sRNA-seq data were 
      analyzed using various bioinformatic tools. Validation of key exmiRNA was 
      performed using specific TaqMan microRNA stem-loop RT-qPCR assays. Results: We 
      investigated the effect of cART, THC, or both cART and THC together on the 
      abundance and compartmentalization of blood plasma exmiRNA in EVs and ECs in 
      SIV-infected RMs. As shown in Manuscript 1 of this series, were in uninfected 
      RMs, ~30% of exmiRNAs were associated with ECs, we confirmed in this follow up 
      manuscript that exmiRNAs were present in both lipid-based carriers-EVs and 
      non-lipid-based carriers-ECs, with 29.5 to 35.6% and 64.2 to 70.5 % being 
      associated with EVs and ECs, respectively. Remarkably, the different treatments 
      (cART, THC) have distinct effects on the enrichment and compartmentalization 
      pattern of exmiRNAs. In the VEH/SIV/cART group, 12 EV-associated and 15 
      EC-associated miRNAs were significantly downregulated. EV-associated miR-206, a 
      muscle-specific miRNA that is present in blood, was higher in the VEH/SIV/ART 
      compared to the VEH/SIV group. ExmiR-139-5p that was implicated in endocrine 
      resistance, focal adhesion, lipid and atherosclerosis, apoptosis, and breast 
      cancer by miRNA-target enrichment analysis was significantly lower in 
      VEH/SIV/cART compared to VEH/SIV, irrespective of the compartment. With respect 
      to THC treatment, 5 EV-associated and 21 EC-associated miRNAs were significantly 
      lower in the VEH/THC/SIV. EV-associated miR-99a-5p was higher in VEH/THC/SIV 
      compared to VEH/SIV, while miR-335-5p counts were significantly lower in both EVs 
      and ECs of THC/SIV compared to VEH/SIV. EVs from SIV/cART/THC combined treatment 
      group have significant increases in the count of eight (miR-186-5p, miR-382-5p, 
      miR-139-5p and miR-652, miR-10a-5p, miR-657, miR-140-5p, miR-29c-3p) miRNAs, all 
      of which were lower in VEH/SIV/cART group. Analysis of miRNA-target enrichment 
      showed that this set of eight miRNAs were implicated in endocrine resistance, 
      focal adhesions, lipid and atherosclerosis, apoptosis, and breast cancer as well 
      as cocaine and amphetamine addiction. In ECs and EVs, combined THC and cART 
      treatment significantly increased miR-139-5p counts compared to VEH/SIV group. 
      Significant alterations in these host miRNAs in both EVs and ECs in the untreated 
      and treated (cART, THC, or both) RMs indicate the persistence of host responses 
      to infection or treatments, and this is despite cART suppression of viral load 
      and THC suppression of inflammation. To gain further insight into the pattern of 
      miRNA alterations in EVs and ECs and to assess potential cause-and-effect 
      relationships, we performed longitudinal miRNA profile analysis, measured in 
      terms of months (1 and 5) post-infection (MPI). We uncovered miRNA signatures 
      associated with THC or cART treatment of SIV-infected macaques in both EVs and 
      ECs. While the number of miRNAs was significantly higher in ECs relative to EVs 
      for all groups (VEH/SIV, SIV/cART, THC/SIV, THC/SIV/cART, and THC) longitudinally 
      from 1 MPI to 5 MPI, treatment with cART and THC have longitudinal effects on the 
      abundance and compartmentalization pattern of exmiRNAs in the two carriers. As 
      shown in Manuscript 1 where SIV infection led to longitudinal suppression of 
      EV-associated miRNA-128-3p, administration of cART to SIV-infected RMs did not 
      increase miR-128-3p but resulted in longitudinal increases in six EV-associated 
      miRNAs (miR-484, miR-107, miR-206, miR-184, miR-1260b, miR-6132). Furthermore, 
      administration of cART to THC treated SIV-infected RMs resulted in a longitudinal 
      decrease in three EV-associated miRNAs (miR-342-3p, miR-100-5p, miR181b-5p) and a 
      longitudinal increase in three EC-associated miRNAs (miR-676-3p, miR-574-3p, 
      miR-505-5p). The longitudinally altered miRNAs in SIV-infected RMs may indicate 
      disease progression, while in the cART Group and the THC Group, the 
      longitudinally altered miRNAs may serve as biomarkers of response to treatment. 
      Conclusions: This paired EVs and ECs miRNAome analyses provided a comprehensive 
      cross-sectional and longitudinal summary of the host exmiRNA responses to SIV 
      infection and the impact of THC, cART, or THC and cART together on the miRNAome 
      during SIV infection. Overall, our data point to previously unrecognized 
      alterations in the exmiRNA profile in blood plasma following SIV infection. Our 
      data also indicate that cART and THC treatment independently and in combination 
      may alter both the abundance and the compartmentalization of several exmiRNA 
      related to various disease and biological processes.

TI  - SIV Infection Regulates Compartmentalization of Circulating Blood Plasma miRNAs 
      within Extracellular Vesicles (EVs) and Extracellular Condensates (ECs) and 
      Decreases EV-Associated miRNA-128.

AB  - Background: This is Manuscript 1 of a two-part Manuscript of the same series. 
      Here, we present findings from our first set of studies on the abundance and 
      compartmentalization of blood plasma extracellular microRNAs (exmiRNAs) into 
      extracellular particles, including blood plasma extracellular vesicles (EVs) and 
      extracellular condensates (ECs) in the setting of untreated HIV/SIV infection. 
      The goals of the study presented in this Manuscript 1 are to (i) assess the 
      abundance and compartmentalization of exmiRNAs in EVs versus ECs in the healthy 
      uninfected state, and (ii) evaluate how SIV infection may affect exmiRNA 
      abundance and compartmentalization in these particles. Considerable effort has 
      been devoted to studying the epigenetic control of viral infection, particularly 
      in understanding the role of exmiRNAs as key regulators of viral pathogenesis. 
      MicroRNA (miRNAs) are small (~20-22 nts) non-coding RNAs that regulate cellular 
      processes through targeted mRNA degradation and/or repression of protein 
      translation. Originally associated with the cellular microenvironment, 
      circulating miRNAs are now known to be present in various extracellular 
      environments, including blood serum and plasma. While in circulation, miRNAs are 
      protected from degradation by ribonucleases through their association with lipid 
      and protein carriers, such as lipoproteins and other extracellular particles-EVs 
      and ECs. Functionally, miRNAs play important roles in diverse biological 
      processes and diseases (cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, stress 
      responses, inflammation, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, aging, neurological 
      diseases, and HIV/SIV pathogenesis). While lipoproteins and EV-associated 
      exmiRNAs have been characterized and linked to various disease processes, the 
      association of exmiRNAs with ECs is yet to be made. Likewise, the effect of SIV 
      infection on the abundance and compartmentalization of exmiRNAs within 
      extracellular particles is unclear. Literature in the EV field has suggested that 
      most circulating miRNAs may not be associated with EVs. However, a systematic 
      analysis of the carriers of exmiRNAs has not been conducted due to the 
      inefficient separation of EVs from other extracellular particles, including ECs. 
      Methods: Paired EVs and ECs were separated from EDTA blood plasma of 
      SIV-uninfected male Indian rhesus macaques (RMs, n = 15). Additionally, paired 
      EVs and ECs were isolated from EDTA blood plasma of combination anti-retroviral 
      therapy (cART) na√Øve SIV-infected (SIV+, n = 3) RMs at two time points (1- and 
      5-months post infection, 1 MPI and 5 MPI). Separation of EVs and ECs was achieved 
      with PPLC, a state-of-the-art, innovative technology equipped with gradient 
      agarose bead sizes and a fast fraction collector that allows high-resolution 
      separation and retrieval of preparative quantities of sub-populations of 
      extracellular particles. Global miRNA profiles of the paired EVs and ECs were 
      determined with RealSeq Biosciences (Santa Cruz, CA) custom sequencing platform 
      by conducting small RNA (sRNA)-seq. The sRNA-seq data were analyzed using various 
      bioinformatic tools. Validation of key exmiRNAs was performed using specific 
      TaqMan microRNA stem-loop RT-qPCR assays. Results: We showed that exmiRNAs in 
      blood plasma are not restricted to any type of extracellular particles but are 
      associated with lipid-based carriers-EVs and non-lipid-based carriers-ECs, with a 
      significant (~30%) proportion of the exmiRNAs being associated with ECs. In the 
      blood plasma of uninfected RMs, a total of 315 miRNAs were associated with EVs, 
      while 410 miRNAs were associated with ECs. A comparison of detectable miRNAs 
      within paired EVs and ECs revealed 19 and 114 common miRNAs, respectively, 
      detected in all 15 RMs. Let-7a-5p, Let-7c-5p, miR-26a-5p, miR-191-5p, and 
      let-7f-5p were among the top 5 detectable miRNAs associated with EVs in that 
      order. In ECs, miR-16-5p, miR-451, miR-191-5p, miR-27a-3p, and miR-27b-3p, in 
      that order, were the top detectable miRNAs in ECs. miRNA-target enrichment 
      analysis of the top 10 detected common EV and EC miRNAs identified MYC and TNPO1 
      as top target genes, respectively. Functional enrichment analysis of top EV- and 
      EC-associated miRNAs identified common and distinct gene-network signatures 
      associated with various biological and disease processes. Top EV-associated 
      miRNAs were implicated in cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions, Th17 cell 
      differentiation, IL-17 signaling, inflammatory bowel disease, and glioma. On the 
      other hand, top EC-associated miRNAs were implicated in lipid and 
      atherosclerosis, Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation, Th17 cell differentiation, and 
      glioma. Interestingly, infection of RMs with SIV revealed that the brain-enriched 
      miR-128-3p was longitudinally and significantly downregulated in EVs, but not 
      ECs. This SIV-mediated decrease in miR-128-3p counts was validated by specific 
      TaqMan microRNA stem-loop RT-qPCR assay. Remarkably, the observed SIV-mediated 
      decrease in miR-128-3p levels in EVs from RMs agrees with publicly available EV 
      miRNAome data by Kaddour et al., 2021, which showed that miR-128-3p levels were 
      significantly lower in semen-derived EVs from HIV-infected men who used or did 
      not use cocaine compared to HIV-uninfected individuals. These findings confirmed 
      our previously reported finding and suggested that miR-128 may be a target of 
      HIV/SIV. Conclusions: In the present study, we used sRNA sequencing to provide a 
      holistic understanding of the repertoire of circulating exmiRNAs and their 
      association with extracellular particles, such as EVs and ECs. Our data also 
      showed that SIV infection altered the profile of the miRNAome of EVs and revealed 
      that miR-128-3p may be a potential target of HIV/SIV. The significant decrease in 
      miR-128-3p in HIV-infected humans and in SIV-infected RMs may indicate disease 
      progression. Our study has important implications for the development of 
      biomarker approaches for various types of cancer, cardiovascular diseases, organ 
      injury, and HIV based on the capture and analysis of circulating exmiRNAs.

      with Distinct Fiber Type Composition.

LID - 659
AB  - The ratio of fast- and slow-twitch fibers in human skeletal muscle is variable 
      and largely determined by genetic factors. In this study, we investigated the 
      contribution of microRNA (miRNA) in skeletal muscle fiber type composition. The 
      study involved biopsy samples of the vastus lateralis muscle from 24 male 
      participants with distinct fiber type ratios. The miRNA study included samples 
      from five endurance athletes and five power athletes with the predominance of 
      slow-twitch (61.6-72.8%) and fast-twitch (69.3-80.7%) fibers, respectively. Total 
      and small RNA were extracted from tissue samples. Total RNA sequencing (N = 24) 
      revealed 352 differentially expressed genes between the groups with the 
      predominance of fast- and slow-twitch muscle fibers. Small RNA sequencing showed 
      upregulation of miR-206, miR-501-3p and miR-185-5p, and downregulation of 
      miR-499a-5p and miR-208-5p in the group of power athletes with fast-twitch fiber 
      predominance. Two miRtronic miRNAs, miR-208b-3p and miR-499a-5p, had strong 
      correlations in expression with their host genes (MYH7 and MYH7B, respectively). 
      Correlations between the expression of miRNAs and their experimentally validated 
      messenger RNA (mRNA) targets were calculated, and 11 miRNA-mRNA interactions with 
      strong negative correlations were identified. Two of them belonged to miR-208b-3p 
      and miR-499a-5p, indicating their regulatory links with the expression of CDKN1A 
      and FOXO4, respectively.

AB  - Growth plate chondrocytes are regulated by numerous factors and hormones as they 
      mature during endochondral bone formation, including transforming growth factor 
      beta-1 (TGFb1), bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2), insulin-like growth factor-1 
      (IFG1), parathyroid hormone and parathyroid hormone related peptide (PTH, PTHrP), 
      and Indian hedgehog (IHH). Chondrocytes in the growth plate's growth zone (GC) 
      produce and export matrix vesicles (MVs) under the regulation of 
      1Œ±,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) [1Œ±,25(OH)(2)D(3)]. 1Œ±,25(OH)(2)D(3) regulates MV 
      enzyme composition genomically and 1Œ±,25(OH)(2)D(3) secreted by the cells acts on 
      the MV membrane nongenomically, destabilizing it and releasing MV enzymes. This 
      study examined the regulatory role 1Œ±,25(OH)(2)D(3) has over production and 
      packaging of microRNA (miRNA) into MVs by GC cells and the release of miRNA by 
      direct action on MVs. Costochondral cartilage GC cells were treated with 
      1Œ±,25(OH)(2)D(3) and the miRNA in the cells and MVs sequenced. We also treated 
      MVs with 1Œ±,25(OH)(2)D(3) and determined if the miRNA was released. To assess 
      whether MVs can act directly with chondrocytes and if this is regulated by 
      1Œ±,25(OH)(2)D(3), we stained MVs with a membrane dye and treated GC cells with 
      them. 1Œ±,25(OH)(2)D(3) regulated production and packaging of a unique population 
      of miRNA into MVs compared to the vehicle control population. 1Œ±,25(OH)(2)D(3) 
      treatment of MVs did not release miRNA. Stained MVs were endocytosed by GC cells 
      and this was increased with 1Œ±,25(OH)(2)D(3) treatment. This study adds new 
      regulatory roles for 1Œ±,25(OH)(2)D(3) with respect to packaging and transport of 
      MV miRNAs.

TI  - Role of the MicroRNAs in the Pathogenic Mechanism of Painful Symptoms in Long 
      COVID: Systematic Review.
LID - 10.3390/ijms24043574 [doi]
LID - 3574
AB  - The ongoing pandemic of COVID-19 has caused more than 6.7 million tragic deaths, 
      plus, a large percentage of people who survived it present a myriad of chronic 
      symptoms that last for at least 6 months; this has been named as long COVID. Some 
      of the most prevalent are painful symptoms like headache, joint pain, migraine, 
      neuropathic-like pain, fatigue and myalgia. MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs 
      that regulate genes, and their involvement in several pathologies has been 
      extensively shown. A deregulation of miRNAs has been observed in patients with 
      COVID-19. The objective of the present systematic review was to show the 
      prevalence of chronic pain-like symptoms of patients with long COVID and based on 
      the expression of miRNAs in patients with COVID-19, and to present a proposal on 
      how they may be involved in the pathogenic mechanisms of chronic pain-like 
      symptoms. A systematic review was carried out in online databases for original 
      articles published between March 2020 to April 2022; the systematic review 
      followed the PRISMA guidelines, and it was registered in PROSPERO with 
      registration number CRD42022318992. A total of 22 articles were included for the 
      evaluation of miRNAs and 20 regarding long COVID; the overall prevalence of 
      pain-like symptoms was around 10 to 87%, plus, the miRNAs that were commonly up 
      and downregulated were miR-21-5p, miR-29a,b,c-3p miR-92a,b-3p, miR-92b-5p, 
      miR-126-3p, miR-150-5p, miR-155-5p, miR-200a, c-3p, miR-320a,b,c,d,e-3p, and 
      miR-451a. The molecular pathways that we hypothesized to be modulated by these 
      miRNAs are the IL-6/STAT3 proinflammatory axis and the compromise of the 
      blood-nerve barrier; these two mechanisms could be associated with the prevalence 
      of fatigue and chronic pain in the long COVID population, plus they could be 
      novel pharmacological targets in order to reduce and prevent these symptoms.

      microRNAs.

LID - 11
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that are known for their role in the 
      post-transcriptional regulation of target genes. Typically, their functions are 
      predicted by first identifying their target genes and then finding biological 
      processes enriched in these targets. Current tools for miRNA functional analysis 
      use only genes with physical binding sites as their targets and exclude other 
      genes that are indirectly targeted transcriptionally through transcription 
      factors. Here, we introduce a method to predict gene ontology (GO) annotations 
      indirectly targeted by microRNAs. The proposed method resulted in better 
      performance in predicting known miRNA-GO term associations compared to the 
      canonical approach. To facilitate miRNA GO enrichment analysis, we developed an R 
      Shiny application, miRinGO, that is freely available online at GitHub.

AB  - Background Maternal body size, nutrition, and hyperglycemia contribute to 
      neonatal body size and composition. There is little information on maternal-fetal 
      transmission of messages which influence fetal growth. We analyzed 
      adipocyte-derived small extracellular vesicular (ADsEV) microRNAs in maternal and 
      cord blood to explore their adipogenic potential. Methods We studied 127 
      mother-neonate pairs (51 lean and 76 adipose neonates, in 68 NGT and 59 GDM 
      pregnancies). Adiposity refers to the highest tertile (T3) of sum of skinfolds in 
      neonates of normal glucose tolerant (NGT) mothers, lean to the to lowest tertile 
      (T1). ADsEV miRNAs from maternal and cord blood samples were profiled on Agilent 
      8*60K microarray. Differential expression (DE) of ADsEV miRNAs in adipose vs. 
      lean neonates was studied before and after adjustment for maternal gestational 
      diabetes mellitus (GDM), adiposity, and vitamin B12-folate status. Results 
      Multiple miRNAs were common in maternal and cord blood and positively correlated. 
      We identified 24 maternal and 5 cord blood miRNAs differentially expressed 
      (p‚Äâ‚â§‚Äâ0.1) in the adipose neonate group, and 19 and 26 respectively, in the 
      adjusted analyses. Even though DE miRNAs were different in maternal and cord 
      blood, they targeted similar adipogenic pathways (e.g., the forkhead box O (FOXO) 
      family of transcription factors, mitogen‚Äëactivated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, 
      transforming growth factor beta (TGF-Œ≤) pathway). Maternal GDM and adiposity were 
      associated with many DE ADsEV miRNAs. Conclusion Our results suggest that the 
      ADsEV miRNAs in mothers are potential regulators of fetal adiposity. The 
      expression and functionality of miRNAs appears to be influenced by maternal 
      adiposity, hyperglycemia, and micronutrient status during pregnancy.

AB  - Introduction: MicroRNAs have a significant role in the regulation of the 
      transcriptome. Several miRNAs have been proposed as potential biomarkers in 
      different malignancies. However, contradictory results have been reported on the 
      capability of miRNA biomarkers in cancer detection. The human biological clock 
      involves molecular mechanisms that regulate several genes over time. Therefore, 
      the sampling time becomes one of the significant factors in gene expression 
      studies. Method: In the present study, we have tried to find miRNAs with minimum 
      fluctuation in expression levels at different time points that could be more 
      accurate candidates as diagnostic biomarkers. The small RNA-seq raw data of ten 
      healthy individuals across nine-time points were analyzed to identify miRNAs with 
      stable expression. Results: We have found five oscillation patterns. The stable 
      miRNAs were investigated in 779 small-RNA-seq datasets of eleven cancer types. 
      All miRNAs with the highest differential expression were selected for further 
      analysis. The selected miRNAs were explored for functional pathways. The 
      predominantly enriched pathways were miRNA in cancer and the P53-signaling 
      pathway. Finally, we have found seven miRNAs, including miR-142-3p, miR-199a-5p, 
      miR-223-5p, let-7d-5p, miR-148b-3p, miR-340-5p, and miR-421. These miRNAs showed 
      minimum fluctuation in healthy blood and were dysregulated in the blood of eleven 
      cancer types. Conclusion: We have found a signature of seven stable miRNAs which 
      dysregulate in several cancer types and may serve as potential pan-cancer 
      biomarkers.

TI  - Transposons Acting as Competitive Endogenous RNAs: In-Silico Evidence from 
      Datasets Characterised by L1 Overexpression.
LID - 10.3390/biomedicines10123279 [doi]
LID - 3279
AB  - LINE L1 are transposable elements that can replicate within the genome by passing 
      through RNA intermediates. The vast majority of these element copies in the human 
      genome are inactive and just between 100 and 150 copies are still able to 
      mobilize. During evolution, they could have been positively selected for 
      beneficial cellular functions. Nonetheless, L1 deregulation can be detrimental to 
      the cell, causing diseases such as cancer. The activity of miRNAs represents a 
      fundamental mechanism for controlling transcript levels in somatic cells. These 
      are a class of small non-coding RNAs that cause degradation or translational 
      inhibition of their target transcripts. Beyond this, competitive endogenous RNAs 
      (ceRNAs), mostly made by circular and non-coding RNAs, have been seen to compete 
      for the binding of the same set of miRNAs targeting protein coding genes. In this 
      study, we have investigated whether autonomously transcribed L1s may act as 
      ceRNAs by analyzing public dataset in-silico. We observed that genes sharing 
      miRNA target sites with L1 have a tendency to be upregulated when L1 are 
      overexpressed, suggesting the possibility that L1 might act as ceRNAs. This 
      finding will help in the interpretation of transcriptomic responses in contexts 
      characterized by the specific activation of transposons.

TI  - NcPath: a novel platform for visualization and enrichment analysis of human 
      non-coding RNA and KEGG signaling pathways.
LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/btac812 [doi]
LID - btac812
AB  - SUMMARY: Non-coding RNAs play important roles in transcriptional processes and 
      participate in the regulation of various biological functions, in particular 
      miRNAs and lncRNAs. Despite their importance for several biological functions, 
      the existing signaling pathway databases do not include information on miRNA and 
      lncRNA. Here, we redesigned a novel pathway database named NcPath by integrating 
      and visualizing a total of 178‚Ää308 human experimentally validated miRNA-target 
      interactions (MTIs), 32‚Ää282 experimentally verified lncRNA-target interactions 
      (LTIs) and 4837 experimentally validated human ceRNA networks across 222 KEGG 
      pathways (including 27 sub-categories). To expand the application potential of 
      the redesigned NcPath database, we identified 556‚Ää798 reliable 
      lncRNA-protein-coding genes (PCG) interaction pairs by integrating co-expression 
      relations, ceRNA relations, co-TF-binding interactions, co-histone-modification 
      interactions, cis-regulation relations and lncPro Tool predictions between 
      lncRNAs and PCG. In addition, to determine the pathways in which miRNA/lncRNA 
      targets are involved, we performed a KEGG enrichment analysis using a 
      hypergeometric test. The NcPath database also provides information on 
      MTIs/LTIs/ceRNA networks, PubMed IDs, gene annotations and the experimental 
      verification method used. In summary, the NcPath database will serve as an 
      important and continually updated platform that provides annotation and 
      visualization of the pathways on which non-coding RNAs (miRNA and lncRNA) are 
      involved, and provide support to multimodal non-coding RNAs enrichment analysis. 
      The NcPath database is freely accessible at http://ncpath.pianlab.cn/. 
      AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: NcPath database is freely available at 
      http://ncpath.pianlab.cn/. The code and manual to use NcPath can be found at 
      https://github.com/Marscolono/NcPath/. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary 
      data are available at Bioinformatics online.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) is a dreadful complication present 
      in up to 30% of patients with spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Indeed, 
      DCI is one of the main causes of long-term disability in SAH, yet its prediction 
      and prevention are troublesome in poor-grade SAH cases. In this prospective 
      study, we explored the potential role of micro ribonucleic acid (microRNA, 
      abbreviated miRNAs)-small non-coding RNAs involved in clue gene regulation at the 
      post-transcriptional level-as biomarkers of neurological outcomes in SAH 
      patients. METHODS: We analyzed the expression of several miRNAs present in the 
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of SAH patients during the early stage of the disease 
      (third-day post-hemorrhage). NanoString Technologies were used for the 
      characterization of the CSF samples. RESULTS: We found an overexpression of 
      miRNAs in the acute stage of 57 SAH in comparison with 10 non-SAH controls. 
      Moreover, a differential expression of specific miRNAs was detected according to 
      the severity of clinical onset, but also regarding the development of DCI and the 
      midterm functional outcomes. CONCLUSION: These observations reinforce the 
      potential utility of miRNAs as prognostic and diagnostic biomarkers in SAH 
      patients. In addition, the identification of specific miRNAs related to SAH 
      evolution might provide insights into their regulatory functions of 
      pathophysiological pathways, such as the TGF-Œ≤ inflammatory pathway and 
      blood-brain barrier disruption.

      maternal recognition of pregnancy.
PG  - 775-797
LID - 10.1096/fba.2022-00063 [doi]
AB  - During initial maternal recognition of pregnancy (MRP), the equine embryo 
      displays a series of unique events characterized by rapid blastocyst expansion, 
      secretion of a diverse array of molecules, and transuterine migration to interact 
      with the uterine surface. Up to date, the intricate transcriptome and proteome 
      changes of the embryo underlying these events have not been critically studied in 
      horses. Thus, the objective of this study was to perform an integrative 
      transcriptomic (including mRNA, miRNAs, and other small non-coding RNAs) and 
      proteomic analysis of embryos collected from days 10 to 13 of gestation. The 
      results revealed dynamic transcriptome profiles with a total of 1311 
      differentially expressed genes, including 18 microRNAs (miRNAs). Two main 
      profiles for mRNAs and miRNAs were identified, one with higher expression in 
      embryos ‚â§5‚Äâmm and the second with higher expression in embryos ‚â•7‚Äâmm. At the 
      protein level, similar results were obtained, with 259 differentially abundant 
      proteins between small and large embryos. Overall, the findings demonstrated 
      fine-tuned transcriptomic and proteomic regulations in the developing embryo 
      associated with embryo growth. The identification of specific regulation of 
      mRNAs, proteins, and miRNAs on days 12 and 13 of gestation suggested these 
      molecules as pivotal for embryo development and as involved in MRP, and in 
      establishment of pregnancy in general. In addition, the results revealed new 
      insights into prostaglandin synthesis by the equine embryo, miRNAs and genes

TI  - High Glycemia and Soluble Epoxide Hydrolase in Females: Differential Multiomics 
      in Murine Brain Microvasculature.
LID - 10.3390/ijms232113044 [doi]
LID - 13044
AB  - The effect of a high glycemic diet (HGD) on brain microvasculature is a crucial, 
      yet understudied research topic, especially in females. This study aimed to 
      determine the transcriptomic changes in female brain hippocampal microvasculature 
      induced by a HGD and characterize the response to a soluble epoxide hydrolase 
      inhibitor (sEHI) as a mechanism for increased epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) 
      levels shown to be protective in prior models of brain injury. We fed mice a HGD 
      or a low glycemic diet (LGD), with/without the sEHI (t-AUCB), for 12 weeks. Using 
      microarray, we assessed differentially expressed protein-coding and noncoding 
      genes, functional pathways, and transcription factors from laser-captured 
      hippocampal microvessels. We demonstrated for the first time in females that the 
      HGD had an opposite gene expression profile compared to the LGD and 
      differentially expressed 506 genes, primarily downregulated, with functions 
      related to cell signaling, cell adhesion, cellular metabolism, and 
      neurodegenerative diseases. The sEHI modified the transcriptome of female mice 
      consuming the LGD more than the HGD by modulating genes involved in metabolic 
      pathways that synthesize neuroprotective EETs and associated with a higher 
      EETs/dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids (DHETs) ratio. Our findings have implications 
      for sEHIs as promising therapeutic targets for the microvascular dysfunction that 
      accompanies vascular dementia.

TI  - miRNAs as Biomarkers in Diabetes: Moving towards Precision Medicine.

LID - 12843
AB  - Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a complex metabolic disease with many specifically 
      related complications. Early diagnosis of this disease could prevent the 
      progression to overt disease and its related complications. There are several 
      limitations to using existing biomarkers, and between 24% and 62% of people with 
      diabetes remain undiagnosed and untreated, suggesting a large gap in current 
      diagnostic practices. Early detection of the percentage of insulin-producing 
      cells preceding loss of function would allow for effective therapeutic 
      interventions that could delay or slow down the onset of diabetes. MicroRNAs 
      (miRNAs) could be used for early diagnosis, as well as for following the 
      progression and the severity of the disease, due to the fact of their pancreatic 
      specific expression and stability in various body fluids. Thus, many studies have 
      focused on the identification and validation of such groups or "signatures of 
      miRNAs" that may prove useful in diagnosing or treating patients. Here, we 
      summarize the findings on miRNAs as biomarkers in diabetes and those associated 
      with direct cellular reprogramming strategies, as well as the relevance of miRNAs 
      that act as a bidirectional switch for cell therapy of damaged pancreatic tissue 
      and the studies that have measured and tracked miRNAs as biomarkers in insulin 
      resistance are addressed.

AB  - The purpose of the present study is to predict by bioinformatics the activity of 
      the extracellular vesicle (EV)-embedded micro RNA (miRNAs) secreted by cartilage 
      cells (CCs), adipose tissue-derived- (ASCs), and bone marrow-derived stem cells 
      (BMSCs) and verify their immunomodulatory potential supporting our bioinformatics 
      findings to optimize the autologous cell-based therapeutic strategies for 
      osteoarthritis (OA) management. Cells were isolated from surgical waste tissues 
      of three patients who underwent total hip replacement, expanded and the EVs were 
      collected. The expression of EV-embedded miRNA was evaluated with the QuantStudio 
      12 K Flex OpenArray(¬Æ) platform. Mientournet and ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) 
      were used for validated target prediction analysis and to identify miRNAs 
      involved in OA and inflammation. Cells shared the expression of 325 miRNAs 
      embedded in EVs and differed for the expression of a small number of them. 
      Mienturnet revealed no results for miRNAs selectively expressed by ASCs, whereas 
      miRNA expressed by CCs and BMSCs were putatively involved in the modulation of 
      cell cycle, senescence, apoptosis, Wingless and Int-1 (Wnt), transforming growth 
      factor beta (TGFŒ≤), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), Notch, Hippo, 
      tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFŒ±), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1Œ≤), insulin like 
      growth factor 1 (IGF-1), RUNX family transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), and 
      endochondral ossification pathways. Cartilage homeostasis, macrophages and T 
      cells activity and inflammatory mediators were identified by IPA as targets of 
      the miRNAs found in all the cell populations. Co-culture tests on macrophages and 
      T cells confirmed the immuno-modulatory ability of CCs, ASCs, and BMSCs. The 
      study findings support the rationale behind the use of cell-based therapy for the 
      treatment of OA.

TI  - Current Insights into miRNA and lncRNA Dysregulation in Diabetes: Signal 
      Transduction, Clinical Trials and Biomarker Discovery.
LID - 10.3390/ph15101269 [doi]
LID - 1269
AB  - Diabetes is one of the most frequently occurring metabolic disorders, affecting 
      almost one tenth of the global population. Despite advances in antihyperglycemic 
      therapeutics, the management of diabetes is limited due to its complexity and 
      associated comorbidities, including diabetic neuropathy, diabetic nephropathy and 
      diabetic retinopathy. Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), including microRNAs (miRNAs) and 
      long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), are involved in the regulation of gene expression 
      as well as various disease pathways in humans. Several ncRNAs are dysregulated in 
      diabetes and are responsible for modulating the expression of various genes that 
      contribute to the 'symptom complex' in diabetes. We review various miRNAs and 
      lncRNAs implicated in diabetes and delineate ncRNA biological networks as well as 
      key ncRNA targets in diabetes. Further, we discuss the spatial regulation of 
      ncRNAs and their role(s) as prognostic markers in diabetes. We also shed light on 
      the molecular mechanisms of signal transduction with diabetes-associated ncRNAs 
      and ncRNA-mediated epigenetic events. Lastly, we summarize clinical trials on 
      diabetes-associated ncRNAs and discuss the functional relevance of the 
      dysregulated ncRNA interactome in diabetes. This knowledge will facilitate the 
      identification of putative biomarkers for the therapeutic management of diabetes 
      and its comorbidities. Taken together, the elucidation of the architecture of 
      signature ncRNA regulatory networks in diabetes may enable the identification of 
      novel biomarkers in the discovery pipeline for diabetes, which may lead to better 
      management of this metabolic disorder.

TI  - Diagnostic performance of microRNAs in the detection of heart failure with 
      reduced or preserved ejection fraction: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 2212-2225
LID - 10.1002/ejhf.2700 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Chronic heart failure (CHF) can be classified as heart failure with 
      preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) or with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). 
      Currently, there is an unmet need for a minimally invasive diagnostic tool for 
      different forms of CHF. We aimed to investigate the diagnostic potential of 
      circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) for the detection of different CHF forms via a 
      systematic review and meta-analysis approach. METHODS AND RESULTS: Comprehensive 
      search on Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, and EMBASE identified 45 relevant 
      studies which were used for qualitative assessment. Out of these, 29 studies were 
      used for qualitative and quantitative assessment and allowed to identify a miRNA 
      panel able to detect HFrEF and HFpEF with areas under the curve (AUC) of 0.86 and 
      0.79, respectively. A panel of eight miRNAs (hsa-miR-18b-3p, hsa-miR-21-5p, 
      hsa-miR-22-3p, hsa-miR-92b-3p, hsa-miR-129-5p, hsa-miR-320a-5p, hsa-miR-423-5p, 
      and hsa-miR-675-5p) detected HFrEF cases with a sensitivity of 0.85, specificity 
      of 0.88 and AUC of 0.91. A panel of seven miRNAs (hsa-miR-19b-3p, hsa-miR-30c-5p, 
      hsa-miR-206, hsa-miR-221-3p, hsa-miR-328-5p, hsa-miR-375-3p, and hsa-miR-424-5p) 
      identified HFpEF cases with a sensitivity of 0.82 and a specificity of 0.61. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Although conventional biomarkers (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic 
      peptide and B-type natriuretic peptide) presented a better performance in 
      detecting CHF patients, the results presented here pointed towards specific miRNA 
      panels with potential additive values to circulating natriuretic peptides in the 
      diagnosis of different classes of CHF. Equally important, miRNAs alone showed a 
      reasonable capacity for 'ruling out' patients with HFrEF or HFpEF. Additional 
      studies with large populations are required to confirm the diagnostic potential 
      of miRNAs for sub-classes of CHF.

TI  - MicroRNA and Hemostasis Profile of Carotid Atherosclerosis.
LID - 10.3390/ijms231810974 [doi]
LID - 10974
AB  - Carotid atherosclerosis (CA) is an important risk factor for ischemic stroke. We 
      described the miRNA and hemostasis profile of patients with moderate and advanced 
      stages of carotid atherosclerosis and elucidated potential correlations with 
      hemostatic activation. A prospective case-control study included 61 patients with 
      evidence of carotid atherosclerosis (via ultrasound). The study population was 
      divided into groups depending on the degree of carotid artery stenosis: 60% or 
      more (advanced) and <60% (moderate). All patients underwent the following blood 
      tests: general blood test, hemostatic parameters and microRNA. Extraction of 
      microRNA was performed using Leukocyte RNA Purification Kit (NORGEN Biotec Corp., 
      Thorold, ON, Canada); miRNA quantification was performed via RT-PCR. Statistical 
      analysis was performed in R programming language (v. 4.1.0) using RSudio. 
      MicroRNA expression profile was different depending on CA degree. MiR-33a-5p/3p 
      levels were higher in patients with ‚â•60% carotid stenosis (42.70 and 42.45 versus 
      38.50 and 38.50, respectively, p < 0.05). Almost complete separation can be 
      visualized with the levels of miR-126-5p: 9.50 in the moderate CA group versus 
      5.25 in the advanced CA (p < 0.001). MiR-29-5p was higher in the moderate CA 
      group: 28.60 [25.50;33.05] than in advanced CA group: 25.75 [24.38;29.50] (p = 
      0.086); miR-29-3p was also higher in the moderate CA group: 10.36 [8.60;14.99] 
      than in advanced CA group: 8.46 [7.47;10.3] (p = 0.001). By-group pairwise 
      correlation analyses revealed at least three clusters with significant positive 
      correlations in the moderate CA group: miR-29-3p with factors V and XII (r = 0.53 
      and r = 0.37, respectively, p < 0.05); miR-21-5p with ADAMTS13, erythrocyte 
      sedimentation rate and D-dimer (r = 0.42, r = 0.36 and r = 0.44, respectively, p 
      < 0.05); stenosis degree with miR-33a-5p/3p and factor VIII levels (r = 0.43 
      (both) and r = 0.62, respectively, p < 0.05). Hemostasis parameters did not 
      reveal significant changes in CA patients: the only statistically significant 
      differences concerned factor VIII, plasminogen and (marginally significant) 
      ADAMTS-13 and protein C. Down-regulation of miR-126-5p expression has been 
      identified as a promising biomarker of advanced carotid atherosclerosis with high 
      specificity and sensitivity. Correlation cluster analysis showed potential 
      interplay between miRNAs and hemostatic activation in the setting of carotid 
      atherosclerosis.

TI  - Oviductal Extracellular Vesicles Enhance Porcine In Vitro Embryo Development by 
      Modulating the Embryonic Transcriptome.
LID - 10.3390/biom12091300 [doi]
LID - 1300
AB  - Oviductal extracellular vesicles (oEVs) have been identified as important 
      components of the oviductal fluid (OF) and have been pointed to as key modulators 
      of gamete/embryo-maternal interactions. Here, we determined the functional impact 
      of oEVs on embryo development and the embryonic transcriptome in porcine. 
      Experiment 1 examined the effect of oEVs and OF on embryo development. In 
      vitro-produced embryos were cultured with oEVs or OF for 2 or 7 days using an in 
      vitro sequential system or without supplementation (control). Experiment 2 
      analyzed transcriptomic alterations of EV-treated embryos versus control and the 
      oEVs RNA cargo by RNA-sequencing. Two days of EV treatment enhanced embryo 
      development over time when compared to other treatments. Different RNA expression 
      profiles between embryos treated with EVs for two or seven days and untreated 
      controls were obtained, with 54 and 59 differentially expressed (DE) genes and 
      six and seven DE miRNAs, respectively. In oEV RNA cargo, 12,998 RNAs and 163 
      miRNAs were identified. Integrative analyses pointed to specific oEV components 
      that might act as modulators of the embryonic transcriptome, such as S100A11, 
      ANXA2 or miR-21-5p. Overall, the findings suggested that oEVs could be a 
      potential strategy to improve porcine IVP outcomes, particularly by using two 
      days of EV treatment.

TI  - Comprehensive Analysis of Serum Small Extracellular Vesicles-Derived Coding and 
      Non-Coding RNAs from Retinoblastoma Patients for Identifying Regulatory 
      Interactions.
LID - 10.3390/cancers14174179 [doi]
LID - 4179
AB  - The present study employed nanoparticle tracking analysis, transmission electron 
      microscopy, immunoblotting, RNA sequencing, and quantitative real-time PCR 
      validation to characterize serum-derived small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) from 
      RB patients and age-matched controls. Bioinformatics methods were used to analyze 
      functions, and regulatory interactions between coding and non-coding (nc) sEVs 
      RNAs. The results revealed that the isolated sEVs are round-shaped with a size < 
      150 nm, 5.3 √ó 1011 ¬± 8.1 particles/mL, and zeta potential of 11.1 to ‚àí15.8 mV, 
      and expressed exosome markers CD9, CD81, and TSG101. A total of 6514 
      differentially expressed (DE) mRNAs, 123 DE miRNAs, and 3634 DE lncRNAs were 
      detected. Both miRNA-mRNA and lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA network analysis revealed that 
      the cell cycle-specific genes including CDKNI1A, CCND1, c-MYC, and HIF1A are 
      regulated by hub ncRNAs MALAT1, AFAP1-AS1, miR145, 101, and 16-5p. 
      Protein-protein interaction network analysis showed that eye-related DE mRNAs are 
      involved in rod cell differentiation, cone cell development, and retinol 
      metabolism. In conclusion, our study provides a comprehensive overview of the RB 
      sEV RNAs and regulatory interactions between them.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In the last 2 years, we have been fighting against SARS-CoV-2 viral 
      infection, which continues to claim victims all over the world. The entire 
      scientific community has been mobilized in an attempt to stop and eradicate the 
      infection. A well-known feature of RNA viruses is their high mutational rate, 
      particularly in specific gene regions. The SARS-CoV-2 S protein is also affected 
      by these changes, allowing viruses to adapt and spread more easily. The vaccines 
      developed using mRNA coding protein S undoubtedly contributed to the "fight" 
      against the COVID-19 pandemic even though the presence of new variants in the 
      spike protein could result in protein conformational changes, which could affect 
      vaccine immunogenicity and thus vaccine effectiveness. RESULTS: The study 
      presents the findings of an in silico analysis using various bioinformatics tools 
      finding conserved sequences inside SARS-CoV-2 S protein (encoding mRNA) same as 
      in the vaccine RNA sequences that could be targeted by specific host RNA-binding 
      proteins (RBPs). According to the results an interesting scenario emerges 
      involving host RBPs competition and subtraction. The presence of viral RNA in 
      cytoplasm could be a new tool in the virus's armory, allowing it to improve its 
      chances of survival by altering cell gene expression and thus interfering with 
      host cell processes. In silico analysis was used also to evaluate the presence of 
      similar human miRNA sequences within RBPs motifs that can modulate human RNA 
      expression. Increased cytoplasmic availability of exogenous RNA fragments derived 
      from RNA physiological degradation could potentially mimic the effect of host 
      human miRNAs within the cell, causing modulation of the host cell network. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our in silico analysis could aid in shedding light on the potential 
      effects of exogenous RNA (i.e. viruses and vaccines), thereby improving our 
      understanding of the cellular interactions between virus and host biomolecules. 
      Finally, using the computational approach, it is possible to obtain a safety 
      assessment of RNA-based vaccines as well as indications for use in specific 
      clinical conditions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 induces a spectrum of clinical conditions ranging from 
      asymptomatic infection to life threatening severe disease. Host microRNAs have 
      been involved in the cytokine storm driven by SARS-CoV-2 infection and proposed 
      as candidate biomarkers for COVID-19. METHODS: To discover signatures of 
      circulating miRNAs associated with COVID-19, disease severity and mortality, 
      small RNA-sequencing was performed on serum samples collected from 89 COVID-19 
      patients (34 severe, 29 moderate, 26 mild) at hospital admission and from 45 
      healthy controls (HC). To search for possible sources of miRNAs, investigation of 
      differentially expressed (DE) miRNAs in relevant human cell types in vitro. 
      RESULTS: COVID-19 patients showed upregulation of miRNAs associated with lung 
      disease, vascular damage and inflammation and downregulation of miRNAs that 
      inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, angiogenesis, and stress 
      response. Compared with mild/moderate disease, patients with severe COVID-19 had 
      a miRNA signature indicating a profound impairment of innate and adaptive immune 
      responses, inflammation, lung fibrosis and heart failure. A subset of the DE 
      miRNAs predicted mortality. In particular, a combination of high serum miR-22-3p 
      and miR-21-5p, which target antiviral response genes, and low miR-224-5p and 
      miR-155-5p, targeting pro-inflammatory factors, discriminated severe from 
      mild/moderate COVID-19 (AUROC 0.88, 95% CI 0.80-0.95, p<0.0001), while high 
      leukocyte count and low levels of miR-1-3p, miR-23b-3p, miR-141-3p, miR-155-5p 
      and miR-4433b-5p predicted mortality with high sensitivity and specificity (AUROC 
      0.95, 95% CI 0.89-1.00, p<0.0001). In vitro experiments showed that some of the 
      DE miRNAs were modulated directly by SARS-CoV-2 infection in permissive lung 
      epithelial cells. CONCLUSIONS: We discovered circulating miRNAs associated with 
      COVID-19 severity and mortality. The identified DE miRNAs provided clues on 
      COVID-19 pathogenesis, highlighting signatures of impaired interferon and 
      antiviral responses, inflammation, organ damage and cardiovascular failure as 
      associated with severe disease and death.

TI  - Biomarkers of Frailty: miRNAs as Common Signatures of Impairment in Cognitive and 
      Physical Domains.
LID - 10.3390/biology11081151 [doi]
LID - 1151
AB  - The past years have seen an increasing concern about frailty, owing to the 
      growing number of elderly people and the major impact of this syndrome on health 
      and social care. The identification of frail people passes through the use of 
      different tests and biomarkers, whose concerted analysis helps to stratify the 
      populations of patients according to their risk profile. However, their 
      efficiency in prognosis and their capability to reflect the multisystemic 
      impairment of frailty is discussed. Recent works propose the use of miRNAs as 
      biological hallmarks of physiological impairment in different organismal 
      districts. Changes in miRNAs expression have been described in biological 
      processes associated with phenotypic outcomes of frailty, opening intriguing 
      possibilities for their use as biomarkers of fragility. Here, with the aim of 
      finding reliable biomarkers of frailty, while considering its complex nature, we 
      revised the current literature on the field, for uncovering miRNAs shared across 
      physical and cognitive frailty domains. By applying in silico analyses, we 
      retrieved the top-ranked shared miRNAs and their targets, finally prioritizing 
      the most significant ones. From this analysis, ten miRNAs emerged which converge 
      into two main biological processes: inflammation and energy homeostasis. Such 
      markers, if validated, may offer promising capabilities for early diagnosis of 
      frailty in the elderly population.

TI  - Entamoeba histolytica HM-1: IMSS gene expression profiling identifies key hub 
      genes, potential biomarkers, and pathways in Amoebiasis infection: a systematic 
      network meta-analysis.
LID - 10.1042/BSR20220191 [doi]
LID - BSR20220191
AB  - Entamoeba histolytica (E. histolytica) is an anaerobic parasite that causes 
      Amoebiasis in the intestine or extraintestinal, with immunology, genetics, and 
      environmental variables all playing a part in the disease's development, but its 
      molecular mechanism is unknown. One of the primary obstacles in understanding the 
      etiology of Amoebiasis will be identifying the genetics profiling that controls 
      the Amoebiasis network. By examining the gene expression profile of Amoebiasis 
      and comparing it with healthy controls, we could identify differentially 
      expressed genes (DEGs). DEGs were used to build the Amoebiasis protein 
      interaction network and calculated its network topological properties. We 
      discovered nine key hub genes (KHGs): JUN, PTGS2, FCGR3A, MNDA, CYBB, EGR1, CCL2, 
      TLR8, and LRRK2 genes. The genes JUN and EGR1 were transcriptional factors (TFs) 
      and up-regulated, others down-regulated. hsa-miR-155-5p, hsa-miR-101-3p, 
      hsa-miR-124-3p, hsa-miR-26b-5p, and hsa-miR-16-5p are also among the essential 
      miRNAs that have been demonstrated to be targeted by KHGs. These KHGs were 
      primarily enriched in the IL-17 signaling pathway, TNF signaling pathway, 
      NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, and Toll-like receptor signaling pathway. 
      miRNAs were grouped in various pathways, focusing on the TGF-Œ≤ signaling pathway, 
      human immunodeficiency virus 1 infection, insulin signaling pathway, signaling 
      pathways regulating pluripotency of stem cells, etc. Amoebiasis KHGs (JUN, PTGS2, 
      CCL2, and MNDA) and their associated miRNAs are the primary targets for 
      therapeutic methods and possible biomarkers. Furthermore, we identified drugs for 
      genes JUN, PTGS2, FCGR3A, CCL2, and LRRK2. KHGs, on the other hand, required 
      experimental validation to prove their efficacy.

TI  - Comprehensive Analyses of miRNAs Revealed miR-92b-3p, miR-182-5p and miR-183-5p 
      as Potential Novel Biomarkers in Melanoma-Derived Extracellular Vesicles.

AB  - Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are important mediators in the intercellular 
      communication, influencing the function and phenotype of different cell types 
      within the tumor micro-milieu and thus promote tumor progression. Since EVs 
      safely transport packages of proteins, lipids and also nucleic acids such as 
      miRNAs, EVs and their cargo can serve as diagnostic and prognostic markers. 
      Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate EV embedded miRNAs specific 
      for melanoma, which could serve as potential biomarkers. In contrast to previous 
      studies, we not only analysed miRNAs from EVs, but also included the miRNA 
      profiles from the EV-secreting cells to identify candidates as suitable 
      biomarkers. While the characterization of EVs derived from normal melanocytes and 
      melanoma cells showed largely comparable properties with regard to size 
      distribution and expression of protein markers, the NGS analyses yielded marked 
      differences for several miRNAs. While miRNA load of EVs derived from normal human 
      epidermal melanocytes (NHEMs) and melanoma cells were very similar, they were 
      highly different from their secreting cells. By comprehensive analyses, six 
      miRNAs were identified to be enriched in both melanoma cells and melanoma 
      cell-derived EVs. Of those, the accumulation of miR-92b-3p, miR-182-5p and 
      miR-183-5p in EVs could be validated in vitro. By functional network generation 
      and pathway enrichment analysis we revealed an association with different tumor 
      entities and signaling pathways contributing melanoma progression. Furthermore, 
      we found that miR-92b-3p, miR-182-5p and miR-183-5p were also enriched in EVs 
      derived from serum of melanoma patients. Our results support the hypothesis that 
      miRNAs derived from EVs can serve as prognostic or diagnostic liquid biopsy 
      markers in melanoma. We identified EV-derived miRNAs and showed that those 
      miRNAs, which were enriched in melanoma cells and EVs, are also found elevated in 
      serum-derived EVs of patients with metastatic melanoma, but not in healthy 
      subjects.

TI  - Multi-Level Biological Network Analysis and Drug Repurposing Based on Leukocyte 
      Transcriptomics in Severe COVID-19: In Silico Systems Biology to Precision

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic causes many morbidity and 
      mortality cases. Despite several developed vaccines and antiviral therapies, some 
      patients experience severe conditions that need intensive care units (ICU); 
      therefore, precision medicine is necessary to predict and treat these patients 
      using novel biomarkers and targeted drugs. In this study, we proposed a 
      multi-level biological network analysis framework to identify key genes via 
      protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis as well as survival analysis 
      based on differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in leukocyte transcriptomic 
      profiles, discover novel biomarkers using microRNAs (miRNA) from regulatory 
      network analysis, and provide candidate drugs targeting the key genes using 
      drug-gene interaction network and structural analysis. The results show that 
      upregulated DEGs were mainly enriched in cell division, cell cycle, and innate 
      immune signaling pathways. Downregulated DEGs were primarily concentrated in the 
      cellular response to stress, lysosome, glycosaminoglycan catabolic process, and 
      mature B cell differentiation. Regulatory network analysis revealed that 
      hsa-miR-6792-5p, hsa-let-7b-5p, hsa-miR-34a-5p, hsa-miR-92a-3p, and 
      hsa-miR-146a-5p were predicted biomarkers. CDC25A, GUSB, MYBL2, and SDAD1 were 
      identified as key genes in severe COVID-19. In addition, drug repurposing from 
      drug-gene and drug-protein database searching and molecular docking showed that 
      camptothecin and doxorubicin were candidate drugs interacting with the key genes. 
      In conclusion, multi-level systems biology analysis plays an important role in 
      precision medicine by finding novel biomarkers and targeted drugs based on key 
      gene identification.

      Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: A Network-Based Approach.
LID - 10.3390/genes13071174 [doi]
LID - 1174
AB  - Lung cancer is the major cause of cancer-associated deaths across the world in 
      both men and women. Lung cancer consists of two major clinicopathological 
      categories, i.e., small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer 
      (NSCLC). Lack of diagnosis of NSCLC at an early stage in addition to poor 
      prognosis results in ineffective treatment, thus, biomarkers for appropriate 
      diagnosis and exact prognosis of NSCLC need urgent attention. The proposed study 
      aimed to reveal essential microRNAs (miRNAs) involved in the carcinogenesis of 
      NSCLC that probably could act as potential biomarkers. The NSCLC-associated 
      expression datasets revealed 12 differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs). 
      MiRNA-mRNA network identified key miRNAs and their associated genes, for which 
      functional enrichment analysis was applied. Further, survival and validation 
      analysis for key genes was performed and consequently transcription factors (TFs) 
      were predicted. We obtained twelve miRNAs as common DEMs after assessment of all 
      datasets. Further, four key miRNAs and nine key genes were extracted from 
      significant modules based on the centrality approach. The key genes and miRNAs 
      reported in our study might provide some information for potential biomarkers 
      profitable to increased prognosis and diagnosis of lung cancer.

TI  - Effects of Hypoxia on RNA Cargo in Extracellular Vesicles from Human 
      Adipose-Derived Stromal/Stem Cells.
LID - 10.3390/ijms23137384 [doi]
LID - 7384
AB  - Mesenchymal stromal/stem cells and their derivates are the most promising cell 
      source for cell therapies in regenerative medicine. The application of 
      extracellular vesicles (EVs) as cell-free therapeuticals requires particles with 
      a maximum regenerative capability to enhance tissue and organ regeneration. The 
      cargo of mRNA and microRNA (miR) in EVs after hypoxic preconditioning has not 
      been extensively investigated. Therefore, the aim of our study was the 
      characterization of mRNA and the miR loading of EVs. We further investigated the 
      effects of the isolated EVs on renal tubular epithelial cells in vitro. We found 
      3131 transcripts to be significantly regulated upon hypoxia. Only 15 of these 
      were downregulated, but 3116 were up-regulated. In addition, we found 190 small 
      RNAs, 169 of these were miRs and 21 were piwi-interacting RNAs (piR). However, 
      only 18 of the small RNAs were significantly altered, seven were miRs and 11 were 
      piRs. Interestingly, all seven miRs were down-regulated after hypoxic 
      pretreatment, whereas all 11 piRs were up-regulated. Gene ontology term 
      enrichment and miR-target enrichment analysis of the mRNAs and miR were also 
      performed in order to study the biological background. Finally, the therapeutic 
      effect of EVs on human renal tubular epithelial cells was shown by the increased 
      expression of three anti-inflammatory molecules after incubation with EVs from 
      hypoxic pretreatment. In summary, our study demonstrates the altered mRNA and miR 
      load in EVs after hypoxic preconditioning, and their anti-inflammatory effect on 
      epithelial cells.

AB  - Converging evidence indicates heavy metal-induced genes, transcription factors 
      (TFs), and microRNAs (miRNAs) are critical pathological components of metabolic 
      syndrome (MetS) and cognitive impairment. Thus, our goals are to identify the 
      interaction of mixed heavy metals (cadmium‚Äâ+‚Äâlead‚Äâ+‚Äâmercury) with genes, TFs, and 
      miRNAs involved in MetS and its components, as well as cognitive impairment 
      development. The most commonly retrieved genes for each disease were different, 
      but essential biological pathways such as oxidative stress, altered lipoprotein 
      metabolism, fluid shear stress and atherosclerosis, apoptosis, the IL-6 signaling 
      pathway, and Alzheimer's disease were highlighted. The genes CASP3, BAX, BCL2, 
      IL6, TNF, APOE, HMOX1, and IGF were found to be mutually affected by the heavy 
      metal mixture studied, suggesting the importance of apoptosis, inflammation, 
      lipid, heme, and glucose metabolism in MetS and cognitive impairment, as well as 
      the potentiality of targeting these genes in prospective therapeutic intervention 
      for these diseases. EGR2, ATF3, and NFE2L2 were noted as the most key TFs 
      implicated in the etiology of MetS and its components, as well as cognitive 
      impairment. We also found six miRNAs induced by studied heavy metals were the 
      mutual miRNAs linked to MetS, its components, and cognitive impairment. In 
      particular, we used miRNAsong to construct and verify a miRNA sponge sequence for 
      these miRNAs. These sponges are promising molecules for the treatment of MetS and 
      its components, as well as cognitive impairment.

TI  - Grapefruit Juice Flavanones Modulate the Expression of Genes Regulating 
      Inflammation, Cell Interactions and Vascular Function in Peripheral Blood 
      Mononuclear Cells of Postmenopausal Women.

AB  - Grapefruit is a rich source of flavanones, phytochemicals suggested excreting 
      vasculoprotective effects. We previously showed that flavanones in grapefruit 
      juice (GFJ) reduced postmenopausal women's pulse-wave velocity (PWV), a measure 
      of arterial stiffness. However, mechanisms of flavanone action in humans are 
      largely unknown. This study aimed to decipher molecular mechanisms of flavanones 
      by multi-omics analysis in PBMCs of volunteers consuming GFJ and flavanone-free 
      control drink for 6 months. Modulated genes and microRNAs (miRNAs) were 
      identified using microarrays. Bioinformatics analyses assessed their functions, 
      interactions and correlations with previously observed changes in PWV. GFJ 
      modified gene and miRNA expressions. Integrated analysis of modulated genes and 
      miRNA-target genes suggests regulation of inflammation, immune response, cell 
      interaction and mobility. Bioinformatics identified putative mediators of the 
      observed nutrigenomic effect (STAT3, NF-Œ∫B) and molecular docking demonstrated 
      potential binding of flavanone metabolites to transcription factors and 
      cell-signaling proteins. We also observed 34 significant correlations between 
      changes in gene expression and PWV. Moreover, global gene expression was 
      negatively correlated with gene expression profiles in arterial stiffness and 
      hypertension. This study revealed molecular mechanisms underlying 
      vasculoprotective effects of flavanones, including interactions with 
      transcription factors and gene and miRNA expression changes that inversely 
      correlate with gene expression profiles associated with cardiovascular risk 
      factors. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: [ClinicalTrials.gov], identifier 
      [NCT01272167].

TI  - Expression Profile and Diagnostic Significance of MicroRNAs in Papillary Thyroid 
      Cancer.
LID - 10.3390/cancers14112679 [doi]
LID - 2679
AB  - The incidence of papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) has increased in recent years. To 
      improve the diagnostic management of PTC, we propose the use of microRNAs 
      (miRNAs) as a biomarker. Our aim in this study was to evaluate the miRNA 
      expression pattern in PTC using NanoString technology. We identified ten miRNAs 
      deregulated in PTC compared with reference tissue: miR-146b-5p, miR-221-3p, 
      miR-221-5p, miR-34-5p, miR-551b-3p, miR-152-3p, miR-15a-5p, miR-31-5p, and 
      miR-7-5p (FDR < 0.05; |fold change (FC)| ‚â• 1.5). The gene ontology (GO) analysis 
      of differentially expressed miRNA (DEM) target genes identified the predominant 
      involvement of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), tyrosine kinase inhibitor 
      resistance, and pathways in cancer in PTC. The highest area under the receiver 
      operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) for DEMs was found for miR-146-5p (AUC 
      = 0.770) expression, indicating possible clinical applicability in PTC diagnosis. 
      The combination of four miRNAs (miR-152-3p, miR-221-3p, miR-551b-3p, and 
      miR-7-5p) showed an AUC of 0.841. Validation by real-time quantitative polymerase 
      chain reactions (qRT-PCRs) confirmed our findings. The introduction of an miRNA 
      diagnostic panel based on the results of our study may help to improve 
      therapeutic decision making for questionable cases. The use of miRNAs as 
      biomarkers of PTC may become an aspect of personalized medicine.

AB  - ST08 is a novel curcumin derivative that exhibited apoptotic and anti-migratory 
      activity in MDA-MB-231, triple-negative breast cancer cells reported earlier. In 
      this study, we further explored the anticancer properties of ST08. ST08 reduced 
      tumor burden in vivo and induced apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway both 
      in vitro and in vivo. ST08 potentiated the effect of cisplatin in vitro and in 
      vivo in mouse EAC breast cancer models with minimal toxicity. ST08 induced 
      alterations in the gene expression were studied by parallel analysis of miRNA and 
      mRNA. 74 differentially expressed miRNA regulated 114 mRNA in triple-negative 
      (MDA-MB-231) cancer cells. Pathway related to the ECM was altered in mesenchymal 
      MDA-MB-231 cells. We constructed a unique miRNA-mRNA interaction network, and one 
      of the pathways regulated by miRNA was NF-Œ∫B. Targets of NF-Œ∫B like MMP1, PTX3, 
      and MMP2 were downregulated in MDA-MB-231 in response to ST08 treatment. PMA 
      induced cell proliferation was abrogated by ST08 treatment, and no additional 
      cell cytotoxicity was observed when used in combination with IKK-16 indicating 
      ST08 regulation of NF-Œ∫B pathway in MDA-MB-231 cells.

TI  - Circulating extracellular vesicles exhibit a differential miRNA profile in 
      gestational diabetes mellitus pregnancies.
PG  - e0267564
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0267564 [doi]
LID - e0267564
AB  - We undertook a prospective temporal study collecting blood samples from 
      consenting pregnant women, to test the hypothesis that circulating extracellular 
      vesicles (EVs) carrying specific non-coding microRNA signatures can underlie 
      gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). To test this hypothesis, miRNA cargo of 
      isolated and characterized EVs revealed contributions from the placenta and 
      differential expression at all three trimesters and at delivery between pregnant 
      and non-pregnant states. Many miRNAs originate from the placental-specific 
      chromosome 19 microRNA cluster (19MC) and chromosome 14 microRNA cluster (14MC). 
      Further a positive correlation emerged between third trimester and at delivery 
      EVs containing miRNAs and those expressed by the corresponding post-parturient 
      placentas (R value = 0.63 to 0.69, p value = 2.2X10-16), in normal and GDM. In 
      addition, distinct differences at all trimesters emerged between women who 
      subsequently developed GDM. Analysis by logistic regression with 
      leave-one-out-cross validation revealed the optimal combination of miRNAs using 
      all the circulating miRNAs (miR-92a-3p, miR-192-5p, miR-451a, miR-122-5p), or 
      using only the differentially expressed miRNAs (has-miR-92a-3p, hsa-miR-92b-3p, 
      hsa-miR-100-5p and hsa-miR-125a-3p) in GDM during the first trimester. As an 
      initial step, both sets of miRNAs demonstrated a predictive probability with an 
      area under the curve of 0.95 to 0.96. These miRNAs targeted genes involved in 
      cell metabolism, proliferation and immune tolerance. In particular genes of the 
      P-I-3-Kinase, FOXO, insulin signaling and glucogenic pathways were targeted, 
      suggestive of placental connectivity with various maternal organs/cells, altering 
      physiology along with pathogenic mechanisms underlying the subsequent development 
      of GDM. We conclude that circulating EVs originating from the placenta with their 
      miRNA cargo communicate and regulate signaling pathways in maternal organs, 
      thereby predetermining development of GDM.

TI  - enrichMiR predicts functionally relevant microRNAs based on target collections.
PG  - W280-W289
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkac395 [doi]
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that are among the main 
      post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression. A number of data collections 
      and prediction tools have gathered putative or confirmed targets of these 
      regulators. It is often useful, for discovery and validation, to harness such 
      collections to perform target enrichment analysis in given transcriptional 
      signatures or gene-sets in order to predict involved miRNAs. While several 
      methods have been proposed to this end, a flexible and user-friendly interface 
      for such analyses using various approaches and collections is lacking. enrichMiR 
      (https://ethz-ins.org/enrichMiR/) addresses this gap by enabling users to perform 
      a series of enrichment tests, based on several target collections, to rank miRNAs 
      according to their likely involvement in the control of a given transcriptional 
      signature or gene-set. enrichMiR results can furthermore be visualised through 
      interactive and publication-ready plots. To guide the choice of the appropriate 
      analysis method, we benchmarked various tests across a panel of experiments 
      involving the perturbation of known miRNAs. Finally, we showcase enrichMiR 
      functionalities in a pair of use cases.

TI  - MicroRNA-132-3p, Downregulated in Myeloid Angiogenic Cells from Hereditary 
      Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia Patients, Is Enriched in the TGFŒ≤ and PI3K/AKT 
      Signalling Pathways.
LID - 10.3390/genes13040665 [doi]
LID - 665
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a rare, autosomal 
      dominant genetic disorder characterized by life-threatening vascular dysplasia. 
      Myeloid angiogenic cells (MACs), alternatively called early endothelial 
      progenitor cells or circulating angiogenic cells, do not directly incorporate 
      into developing blood vessels, but augment angiogenesis in a paracrine manner. 
      MAC dysfunction has been reported in HHT. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate cellular 
      function by modulating gene expression post-transcriptionally. To date, the role 
      of miRNAs in HHT MAC dysfunction has not been documented. OBJECTIVE: The goal of 
      this study was to comparatively profile miRNAs in HHT patient and control MACs to 
      identify dysregulated miRNAs that may be responsible for the observed MAC 
      dysfunction in HHT. METHODOLOGY/RESULTS: Twenty-three dysregulated miRNAs 
      (twenty-one upregulated and two downregulated) in HHT MACs were identified with a 
      TaqMan miRNA microarray. Pathway enrichment analysis showed that the dysregulated 
      miRNAs were significantly enriched in pathways involved in HHT pathogenesis, such 
      as the transforming growth factor Œ≤ (TGFŒ≤), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein 
      kinase B (PI3K/AKT), and Hippo signalling pathways. Furthermore, miR-132-3p was 
      determined to be significantly reduced in HHT MACs compared with controls by 
      reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). 
      Bioinformatic analysis revealed that miR-132-3p is significantly enriched in the 
      TGFŒ≤ and PI3K/AKT signalling pathways, targeting SMAD4, an effector of the TGFŒ≤ 
      signalling pathway and RASA1, a negative regulator of the PI3K/AKT signalling 
      pathway, respectively. CONCLUSION: MiRNA dysregulation, specifically reduced 
      expression of miR-132-3p, in HHT MACs was identified. The dysregulated miRNAs are 
      significantly enriched in the TGFŒ≤, PI3K/AKT, and Hippo signalling pathways. 
      These data suggest that alteration in miRNA expression may impair these pathways 
      and contribute to MAC dysfunction in HHT.

TI  - Determining extracellular vesicles properties and miRNA cargo variability in 
      bovine milk from healthy cows and cows undergoing subclinical mastitis.
PG  - 189
LID - 10.1186/s12864-022-08377-z [doi]
LID - 189
AB  - BACKGROUND: Subclinical mastitis, the inflammation of the mammary gland lacking 
      clinical symptoms, is one of the most prevalent and costly diseases in dairy 
      farming worldwide. Milk microRNAs (miRNAs) encapsulated in extracellular vesicles 
      (EVs) have been proposed as potential biomarkers of different mammary gland 
      conditions, including subclinical mastitis. However, little is known about the 
      robustness of EVs analysis regarding sampling time-point and natural infections. 
      To estimate the reliability of EVs measurements in raw bovine milk, we first 
      evaluated changes in EVs size and concentration using Tunable Resistive Pulse 
      Sensing (TRPS) during three consecutive days of sampling. Then, we analysed daily 
      differences in miRNA cargo using small RNA-seq. Finally, we compared milk EVs 
      differences from naturally infected udder quarters with their healthy adjacent 
      quarters and quarters from uninfected udders, respectively. RESULTS: We found 
      that the milk EV miRNA cargo was very stable over the course of three days 
      regardless of the health status of the quarter, and that infected quarters did 
      not induce relevant changes in milk EVs of adjacent healthy quarters. Chronic 
      subclinical mastitis induced changes in milk EV miRNA cargo, but neither in EVs 
      size nor concentration. We observed that the changes in immunoregulatory miRNAs 
      in quarters with chronic subclinical mastitis were cow-individual, however, the 
      most upregulated miRNA was bta-miR-223-3p across all individuals. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Our results showed that the miRNA profile and particle size characteristics 
      remained constant throughout consecutive days, suggesting that miRNAs packed in 
      EVs are physiological state-specific. In addition, infected quarters were solely 
      affected while adjacent healthy quarters remained unaffected. Finally, the 
      cow-individual miRNA changes pointed towards infection-specific alterations.

LID - 42
AB  - BACKGROUND: Atherosclerosis is one of the major causes of cardiovascular disease. 
      It is characterized by the accumulation of atherosclerotic plaque in arteries 
      under the influence of inflammatory responses, proliferation of smooth muscle 
      cell, accumulation of modified low density lipoprotein. The pathophysiology of 
      atherosclerosis involves the interplay of a number of genes and metabolic 
      pathways. In traditional translation method, only a limited number of genes and 
      pathways can be studied at once. However, the new paradigm of network medicine 
      can be explored to study the interaction of a large array of genes and their 
      functional partners and their connections with the concerned disease 
      pathogenesis. Thus, in our study we employed a branch of network medicine, gene 
      network analysis as a tool to identify the most crucial genes and the miRNAs that 
      regulate these genes at the post transcriptional level responsible for 
      pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. RESULT: From NCBI database 988 atherosclerotic 
      genes were retrieved. The protein-protein interaction using STRING database 
      resulted in 22,693 PPI interactions among 872 nodes (genes) at different 
      confidence score. The cluster analysis of the 872 genes using MCODE, a plug-in of 
      Cytoscape software revealed a total of 18 clusters, the topological parameter and 
      gene ontology analysis facilitated in the selection of four influential genes 
      viz., AGT, LPL, ITGB2, IRS1 from cluster 3. Further, the miRNAs (miR-26, miR-27, 
      and miR-29 families) targeting these genes were obtained by employing MIENTURNET 
      webtool. CONCLUSION: Gene network analysis assisted in filtering out the 4 
      probable influential genes and 3 miRNA families in the pathogenesis of 
      atherosclerosis. These genes, miRNAs can be targeted to restrict the occurrence 
      of atherosclerosis. Given the importance of atherosclerosis, any approach in the 
      understanding the genes involved in its pathogenesis can substantially enhance 
      the health care system.

TI  - Serological profiling reveals hsa-miR-451a as a possible biomarker of 
      anaphylaxis.
LID - 10.1172/jci.insight.156669 [doi]
LID - e156669
AB  - BackgroundThere is a need to support the diagnosis of anaphylaxis by objective 
      markers. miRNAs are promising noncoding RNA species that may serve as serological 
      biomarkers, but their use in diagnosing anaphylaxis has not been systematically 
      studied to our knowledge. We aimed to comprehensively investigate serum biomarker 
      profiles (proteins, lipids, and miRNAs) to support the diagnosis of 
      anaphylaxis.MethodsAdult patients admitted to the emergency room with a diagnosis 
      of anaphylaxis (<3 hours) were included. Blood samples were taken upon emergency 
      room arrival and 1 month later.ResultsNext-generation sequencing of 18 samples (6 
      patients with anaphylaxis in both acute and nonacute condition, for 12 total 
      samples, and 6 healthy controls) identified hsa-miR-451a to be elevated during 
      anaphylaxis, which was verified by quantitative real-time PCR in the remaining 
      cohort. The random forest classifier enabled us to classify anaphylaxis with high 
      accuracy using a composite model. We identified tryptase, 9Œ±,11Œ≤-PGF2, 
      apolipoprotein A1, and hsa-miR-451a as serological biomarkers of anaphylaxis. 
      These predictors qualified as serological biomarkers individually but performed 
      better in combination.ConclusionUnexpectedly, hsa-miR-451a was identified as the 
      most relevant biomarker in our data set. We were also able to distinguish between 
      patients with a history of anaphylaxis and healthy individuals with higher 
      accuracy than any other available model. Future studies will need to verify miRNA 
      biomarker utility in real-life clinical settings.FundingThis work is funded by

TI  - Plasma miRNA profile at COVID-19 onset predicts severity status and mortality.

AB  - BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have a crucial role in regulating immune response 
      against infectious diseases, showing changes early in disease onset and before 
      the detection of the pathogen. Thus, we aimed to analyze the plasma miRNA profile 
      at COVID-19 onset to identify miRNAs as early prognostic biomarkers of severity 
      and survival. METHODS AND RESULTS: Plasma miRNome of 96 COVID-19 patients that 
      developed asymptomatic/mild, moderate and severe disease was sequenced together 
      with a group of healthy controls. Plasma immune-related biomarkers were also 
      assessed. COVID-19 patients showed 200 significant differentially expressed (SDE) 
      miRNAs concerning healthy controls, with upregulated putative targets of 
      SARS-CoV-2, and inflammatory miRNAs. Among COVID-19 patients, 75 SDE miRNAs were 
      observed in asymptomatic/mild compared to symptomatic patients, which were 
      involved in platelet aggregation and cytokine pathways, among others. Moreover, 
      137 SDE miRNAs were identified between severe and moderate patients, where miRNAs 
      targeting the SARS CoV-2 genome were the most strongly disrupted. Finally, we 
      constructed a mortality predictive risk score (miRNA-MRS) with ten miRNAs. 
      Patients with higher values had a higher risk of 90-days mortality (hazard 
      ratio‚Äâ=‚Äâ4.60; p-value‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.001). Besides, the discriminant power of miRNA-MRS was 
      significantly higher than the observed for age and gender (AUROC‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.970 vs. 
      0.881; p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.042). CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 infection deeply disturbs the plasma 
      miRNome from an early stage of COVID-19, making miRNAs highly valuable as early 
      predictors of severity and mortality.

AB  - The rate of progression from Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's 
      disease (AD) is estimated at >10% per year, reaching up to 80-90% after 6 years. 
      MCI is considered an indicator of early-stage AD. In this context, the diagnostic 
      screening of MCI is crucial for detecting individuals at high risk of AD before 
      they progress and manifest further severe symptoms. Typically, MCI has been 
      determined using neuropsychological assessment tools such as the Montreal 
      Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) or Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE). 
      Unfortunately, other diagnostic methods are not available or are unable to 
      identify MCI in its early stages. Therefore, identifying new biomarkers for MCI 
      diagnosis and prognosis is a significant challenge. In this framework, miRNAs in 
      serum, plasma, and other body fluids have emerged as a promising source of 
      biomarkers for MCI and AD-related cognitive impairments. Interestingly, miRNAs 
      can regulate several signaling pathways via multiple and diverse targets in 
      response to pathophysiological stimuli. This systematic review aims to describe 
      the current state of the art regarding AD-related target genes modulated by 
      differentially expressed miRNAs in peripheral fluids samples in MCI subjects to 
      identify potential miRNA biomarkers in the early stages of AD. We found 30 
      articles that described five miRNA expression profiles from peripheral fluid in 
      MCI subjects, showing possible candidates for miRNA biomarkers that may be 
      followed up as fluid biomarkers or therapeutic targets of early-stage AD. 
      However, additional research is needed to validate these miRNAs and characterize 
      the precise neuropathological mechanisms.

AB  - With the understanding of microRNA (miRNA or miR) functions in tumor initiation, 
      progression, and metastasis, efforts are underway to develop new miRNA-based 
      therapies. Very recently, we demonstrated effectiveness of a novel humanized 
      bioengineered miR-124-3p prodrug in controlling spontaneous lung metastasis in 
      mouse models. This study was to investigate the molecular and cellular mechanisms 
      by which miR-124-3p controls tumor metastasis. Proteomics study identified a set 
      of proteins selectively and significantly downregulated by bioengineered 
      miR-124-3p in A549¬†cells, which were assembled into multiple cellular components 
      critical for metastatic potential. Among them, plectin (PLEC) was verified as a 
      new direct target for miR-124-3p that links cytoskeleton components and 
      junctions. In miR-124-3p-treated lung cancer and osteosarcoma cells, protein 
      levels of vimentin, talin 1 (TLN1), integrin beta-1 (ITGB1), IQ motif containing 
      GTPase activating protein 1 (IQGAP1), cadherin 2 or N-cadherin (CDH2), and 
      junctional adhesion molecule A (F11R or JAMA or JAM1) decreased, causing 
      remodeling of cytoskeletons and disruption of cell-cell junctions. Furthermore, 
      miR-124-3p sharply suppressed the formation of focal adhesion plaques, leading to 
      reduced cell adhesion capacity. Additionally, efficacy and safety of biologic 
      miR-124-3p therapy was established in an aggressive experimental metastasis mouse 
      model in¬†vivo. These results connect miR-124-3p-PLEC signaling to other elements 
      in the control of cytoskeleton, cell junctions, and adhesion essential for cancer 
      cell invasion and extravasation towards metastasis, and support the promise of 
      miR-124 therapy.

      Parkinson's Disease.
PG  - e2100959

AB  - SCOPE: Diets rich in (poly)phenols have been associated with positive effects on 
      neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson's disease (PD). Several 
      low-molecular weight (poly)phenol metabolites (LMWPM) are found in the plasma 
      after consumption of (poly)phenol-rich food. It is expected that LMWPM, upon 
      reaching the brain, may have beneficial effects against both oxidative stress and 
      neuroinflammation, and possibly attenuate cell death mechanisms relate to the 
      loss of dopaminergic neurons in PD. METHODS AND RESULTS: This study 
      investigates¬†the neuroprotective potential of two blood-brain barrier permeant 
      LMWPM, catechol-O-sulfate (cat-sulf), and pyrogallol-O-sulfate (pyr-sulf),¬†in a 
      human 3D cell model of PD. Neurospheroids were generated from LUHMES neuronal 
      precursor cells and challenged by 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP(+) ) to induce 
      neuronal stress. LMWPM pretreatments were differently neuroprotective towards 
      MPP(+) insult, presenting distinct effects on the neuronal transcriptome. 
      Particularly, cat-sulf pretreatment appeared to boost counter-regulatory defense 
      mechanisms (preconditioning). When MPP(+) is applied, both LMWPM positively 
      modulated glutathione metabolism and heat-shock response, as also favorably 
      shifting the balance of pro/anti-apoptotic proteins. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings

TI  - A Bioinformatics Approach to Identifying Potential Biomarkers for Cryptosporidium 
      parvum: A Coccidian Parasite Associated with Fetal Diarrhea.
LID - 10.3390/vaccines9121427 [doi]
LID - 1427
AB  - Cryptosporidium parvum (C. parvum) is a protozoan parasite known for 
      cryptosporidiosis in pre-weaned calves. Animals and patients with 
      immunosuppression are at risk of developing the disease, which can cause 
      potentially fatal diarrhoea. The present study aimed to construct a network 
      biology framework based on the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of C. parvum 
      infected subjects. In this way, the gene expression profiling analysis of C. 
      parvum infected individuals can give us a snapshot of actively expressed genes 
      and transcripts under infection conditions. In the present study, we have 
      analyzed microarray data sets and compared the gene expression profiles of the 
      patients with the different data sets of the healthy control. Using a network 
      medicine approach to identify the most influential genes in the gene interaction 
      network, we uncovered essential genes and pathways related to C. parvum 
      infection. We identified 164 differentially expressed genes (109 up- and 54 
      down-regulated DEGs) and allocated them to pathway and gene set enrichment 
      analysis. The results underpin the identification of seven significant hub genes 
      with high centrality values: ISG15, MX1, IFI44L, STAT1, IFIT1, OAS1, IFIT3, 
      RSAD2, IFITM1, and IFI44. These genes are associated with diverse biological 
      processes not limited to host interaction, type 1 interferon production, or 
      response to IL-gamma. Furthermore, four genes (IFI44, IFIT3, IFITM1, and MX1) 
      were also discovered to be involved in innate immunity, inflammation, apoptosis, 
      phosphorylation, cell proliferation, and cell signaling. In conclusion, these 
      results reinforce the development and implementation of tools based on gene 
      profiles to identify and treat Cryptosporidium parvum-related diseases at an 
      early stage.

TI  - Transient Hyperglycemia and Hypoxia Induce Memory Effects in AngiomiR Expression 
      Profiles of Feto-Placental Endothelial Cells.
LID - 10.3390/ijms222413378 [doi]
LID - 13378
AB  - Gestational diabetes (GDM) and preeclampsia (PE) are associated with fetal 
      hyperglycemia, fetal hypoxia, or both. These adverse conditions may compromise 
      fetal and placental endothelial cells. In fact, GDM and PE affect feto-placental 
      endothelial function and also program endothelial function and cardiovascular 
      disease risk of the offspring in the long-term. MicroRNAs are short, non-coding 
      RNAs that regulate protein translation and fine tune biological processes. A 
      group of microRNAs termed angiomiRs is particularly involved in the regulation of 
      endothelial function. We hypothesized that transient hyperglycemia and hypoxia 
      may alter angiomiR expression in feto-placental endothelial cells (fpEC). Thus, 
      we isolated primary fpEC after normal, uncomplicated pregnancy, and induced 
      hyperglycemia (25 mM) and hypoxia (6.5%) for 72 h, followed by reversal to normal 
      conditions for another 72 h. Current vs. transient effects on angiomiR profiles 
      were analyzed by RT-qPCR and subjected to miRNA pathway analyses using DIANA 
      miRPath, MIENTURNET and miRPathDB. Both current and transient hypoxia affected 
      angiomiR profile stronger than current and transient hyperglycemia. Both stimuli 
      altered more angiomiRs transiently, i.e., followed by 72 h culture at control 
      conditions. Pathway analysis revealed that hypoxia significantly altered the 
      pathway 'Proteoglycans in cancer'. Transient hypoxia specifically affected miRNAs 
      related to 'adherens junction'. Our data reveal that hyperglycemia and hypoxia 
      induce memory effects on angiomiR expression in fpEC. Such memory effects may 
      contribute to long-term adaption and maladaption to hyperglycemia and hypoxia.

TI  - Network-based identification of miRNAs and transcription factors and in silico 
      drug screening targeting Œ¥-secretase involved in Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - e08502
LID - 10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e08502 [doi]
LID - e08502
AB  - BACKGROUND: System medicine approaches have played a pivotal role in identifying 
      novel disease networks especially in miRNA research. It is no wonder that miRNAs 
      are implicated in multiple clinical conditions, allowing us to establish the hubs 
      and nodes for network models of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). AD is an age-related, 
      progressive, irreversible, and multifactorial neurodegenerative disorder 
      characterized by cognitive and memory impairment and is the most common cause of 
      dementia in older adults. Worldwide, around 50 million people have dementia, and 
      there are nearly 10 million new cases every year. Œ¥-secretase, also known as 
      asparagine endopeptidase (AEP) or legumain (LGMN), is a lysosomal cysteine 
      protease that cleaves peptide bonds C-terminally to asparagine residues in both 
      amyloid precursor protein (APP) and tau, mediating the amyloid-Œ≤ and tau 
      pathology in AD. The patient's miRNA expression was found to be deregulated in 
      the brain, extracellular fluid, blood plasma, and serum. METHODS: Protein-Protein 
      Interaction (PPI) networks of LGMN or Œ¥-secretase were constructed using the 
      Genemania database. Network Analyzer, a Cytoscape plugin, analyzed the network 
      topological properties of LGMN. miRNAs related to Alzheimer's were extracted from 
      the HMDD (Human microRNA Disease Database) and experimentally verified miRNA-gene 
      interaction was obtained by searching miRWalk. Starbase v2.0 and miRanda were 
      used for screening miRNA of LGMN genes. Moreover, to understand the regulatory 
      mechanism in AD, we have screened major transcription factors of LGMN targeted 
      genes using the Network Analyst 3.0, TRRUST (v2.0) server, and ENCODE. The 
      Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) and BEST tool were used to investigate the 
      expression pattern of the LGMN gene. In parallel, we performed in-silico drug 
      designing of the novel inhibitor scaffold of Œ¥-secretase as powerful therapeutic 
      targets by using the concept of scaffolds and frameworks. In this context, this 
      study also aimed at identifying effective small molecule inhibitors targeting 
      Œ¥-secretase. RESULTS: Among the 16 experimentally verified miRNAs, Network 
      analysis of the LGMN and its associated miRNA identify novel hsa-miRNA-106a-5p 
      and hsa-miRNA-34a-5p being more expressed in the brain. Our in silico high 
      throughput screening, followed by XP docking revealed Oprea1 as the lead. 
      Molecular dynamic simulations of the Œ¥-secretase-docked complex have been carried 
      out for a time period of 200 ns and revealed that Root Mean Square Deviation 
      (RMSD) of the protein CŒ±-backbone with respect to its starting position increased 
      to 1.20 √Ö for the first 25 ns of the trajectory and then became stable around 0.6 
      √Ö in the last 170 ns course of the simulation. The radius of gyration (RGYR) 
      reveals that compactness was maintained till the end of simulations. CONCLUSION: 
      Network analysis of LGMN associated miRNAs lead to the identification of two 
      novel miRNAs, being highly expressed in the brain. This study also lead to the 
      identification and expression of 10 Transcription factors associated with LGMN. 
      Expression Heatmap results show high and continuous expression of LGMN in most of 
      the regions of the brain, especially in the frontal cortex. Further, in silico 
      drug analysis led us to the identification of Oprea1 which could be taken for 
      further investigation to explore its potential for AD therapy.

TI  - Gene Network Analysis of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Identifies Modules Associated 
      with Disease Progression, Survival, and Chemo Drug Resistance.
PG  - 9333-9347
LID - 10.2147/IJGM.S336729 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second leading cause of 
      cancer-related mortality worldwide. HCC transcriptome has been extensively 
      studied; however, the progress in disease mechanisms, prognosis, and treatment is 
      still slow. METHODS: A rank-based module-centric workflow was introduced to 
      analyze important modules associated with HCC development, prognosis, and drug 
      resistance. The currently largest HCC cell line RNA-Seq dataset from the LIMORE 
      database was used to construct the reference modules by weighted gene 
      co-expression network analysis. RESULTS: Thirteen reference modules were 
      identified with validated reproducibility. These modules were all associated with 
      specific biological functions. Differentially expressed module analysis revealed 
      the crucial modules during HCC development. Modules and hub genes are indicative 
      of patient survival. Modules can differentiate patients in different HCC stages. 
      Furthermore, drug resistance was revealed by drug-module association analysis. 
      Based on differentially expressed modules and hub genes, six candidate drugs were 
      screened. The hub genes of those modules merit further investigation. CONCLUSION: 
      We proposed a reference module-based analysis of the HCC transcriptome. The 
      identified modules are associated with HCC development, survival, and drug 
      resistance. M3 and M6 may play important roles during HCV to HCC development. M1, 
      M3, M5, and M7 are associated with HCC survival. High M4, high M9, low M1, and 
      low M3 may be associated with dasatinib, doxorubicin, CD532, and simvastatin 
      resistance. Our analysis provides useful information for HCC diagnosis and 
      treatment.

TI  - Inhibition of Soluble Epoxide Hydrolase Is Protective against the Multiomic 
      Effects of a High Glycemic Diet on Brain Microvascular Inflammation and Cognitive 
      Dysfunction.
LID - 10.3390/nu13113913 [doi]

AB  - Diet is a modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and dementia, 
      yet relatively little is known about the effect of a high glycemic diet (HGD) on 
      the brain's microvasculature. The objective of our study was to determine the 
      molecular effects of an HGD on hippocampal microvessels and cognitive function 
      and determine if a soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) inhibitor (sEHI), known to be 
      vasculoprotective and anti-inflammatory, modulates these effects. Wild type male 
      mice were fed a low glycemic diet (LGD, 12% sucrose/weight) or an HGD (34% 
      sucrose/weight) with/without the sEHI, 
      trans-4-[4-(3-adamantan-1-yl-ureido)-cyclohexyloxy]-benzoic acid (t-AUCB), for 12 
      weeks. Brain hippocampal microvascular gene expression was assessed by microarray 
      and data analyzed using a multi-omic approach for differential expression of 
      protein and non-protein-coding genes, gene networks, functional pathways, and 
      transcription factors. Global hippocampal microvascular gene expression was 
      fundamentally different for mice fed the HGD vs. the LGD. The HGD response was 
      characterized by differential expression of 608 genes involved in cell signaling, 
      neurodegeneration, metabolism, and cell adhesion/inflammation/oxidation effects 
      reversible by t-AUCB and hence sEH inhibitor correlated with protection against 
      Alzheimer's dementia. Ours is the first study to demonstrate that high dietary 
      glycemia contributes to brain hippocampal microvascular inflammation through sEH.

TI  - MicroRNAs based regulation of cytokine regulating immune expressed genes and 
      their transcription factors in COVID-19.
PG  - 100990
LID - 10.1016/j.mgene.2021.100990 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 is characterized by the elevation of a broad 
      spectrum of inflammatory mediators associated with poor disease outcomes. We 
      aimed at an in-silico analysis of regulatory microRNA and their transcription 
      factors (TF) for these inflammatory genes that may help to devise potential 
      therapeutic strategies in the future. METHODS: The cytokine regulating 
      immune-expressed genes (CRIEG) were sorted from literature and the GEO microarray 
      dataset. Their co-differentially expressed miRNA and transcription factors were 
      predicted from publicly available databases. Enrichment analysis was done through 
      mienturnet, MiEAA, Gene Ontology, and pathways predicted by KEGG and Reactome 
      pathways. Finally, the functional and regulatory features were analyzed and 
      visualized through Cytoscape. RESULTS: Sixteen CRIEG were observed to have a 
      significant protein-protein interaction network. The ontological analysis 
      revealed significantly enriched pathways for biological processes, molecular 
      functions, and cellular components. The search performed in the miRNA database 
      yielded ten miRNAs that are significantly involved in regulating these genes and 
      their transcription factors. CONCLUSION: An in-silico representation of a network 
      involving miRNAs, CRIEGs, and TF, which take part in the inflammatory response in 
      COVID-19, has been elucidated. Thus, these regulatory factors may have 
      potentially critical roles in the inflammatory response in COVID-19 and may be 
      explored further to develop targeted therapeutic strategies and mechanistic 
      validation.

AB  - Drug discovery relies on the knowledge of not only drugs and targets, but also 
      the comparative agents and targets. These include poor binders and non-binders 
      for developing discovery tools, prodrugs for improved therapeutics, co-targets of 
      therapeutic targets for multi-target strategies and off-target investigations, 
      and the collective structure-activity and drug-likeness landscapes of enhanced 
      drug feature. However, such valuable data are inadequately covered by the 
      available databases. In this study, a major update of the Therapeutic Target 
      Database, previously featured in NAR, was therefore introduced. This update 
      includes (a) 34 861 poor binders and 12 683 non-binders of 1308 targets; (b) 534 
      prodrug-drug pairs for 121 targets; (c) 1127 co-targets of 672 targets regulated 
      by 642 approved and 624 clinical trial drugs; (d) the collective 
      structure-activity landscapes of 427 262 active agents of 1565 targets; (e) the 
      profiles of drug-like properties of 33 598 agents of 1102 targets. Moreover, a 
      variety of additional data and function are provided, which include the 
      cross-links to the target structure in PDB and AlphaFold, 159 and 1658 newly 
      emerged targets and drugs, and the advanced search function for multi-entry 
      target sequences or drug structures. The database is accessible without login

AB  - There is a lack of predictive markers for early and rapid identification of 
      disease progression in COVID-19 patients. Our study aims at identifying microRNAs 
      (miRNAs)/small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) as potential biomarkers of COVID-19 
      severity. Using differential expression analysis of microarray data (n = 29), we 
      identified hsa-miR-1246, ACA40, hsa-miR-4532, hsa-miR-145-5p, and ACA18 as the 
      top five differentially expressed transcripts in severe versus asymptomatic, and 
      ACA40, hsa-miR-3609, ENSG00000212378 (SNORD78), hsa-miR-1231, hsa-miR-885-3p as 
      the most significant five in severe versus mild cases. Moreover, we found that

TI  - Network Analysis Integrating microRNA Expression Profiling with MRI Biomarkers 
      and Clinical Data for Prostate Cancer Early Detection: A Proof of Concept Study.
LID - 10.3390/biomedicines9101470 [doi]
LID - 1470
AB  - The MRI of the prostate is the gold standard for the detection of clinically 
      significant prostate cancer (csPCa). Nonetheless, MRI still misses around 11% of 
      clinically significant disease. The aim was to comprehensively integrate tissue 
      and circulating microRNA profiling, MRI biomarkers and clinical data to implement 
      PCa early detection. In this prospective cohort study, 76 biopsy na√Øve patients 
      underwent MRI and MRI directed biopsy. A sentinel sample of 15 patients was 
      selected for a pilot molecular analysis. Weighted gene coexpression network 
      analysis was applied to identify the microRNAs drivers of csPCa. MicroRNA-target 
      gene interaction maps were constructed, and enrichment analysis performed. The 
      ANOVA on ranks test and ROC analysis were performed for statistics. Disease 
      status was associated with the underexpression of the miRNA profiled; a 
      correlation was found with ADC (r = -0.51, p = 0.02) and normalized ADC values (r 
      = -0.64, p = 0.002). The overexpression of miRNAs from plasma was associated with 
      csPCa (r = 0.72; p = 0.02), and with PI-RADS assessment score (r = 0.73; p = 
      0.02); a linear correlation was found with biomarkers of diffusion and perfusion. 
      Among the 800 profiled microRNA, eleven were identified as correlating with PCa, 
      among which miR-548a-3p, miR-138-5p and miR-520d-3p were confirmed using the 
      RT-qPCR approach on an additional cohort of ten subjects. ROC analysis showed an 
      accuracy of >90%. Provided an additional validation set of the identified miRNAs 
      on a larger cohort, we propose a diagnostic paradigm shift that sees molecular 
      data and MRI biomarkers as the prebiopsy triage of patients at risk for PCa. This 
      approach will allow for accurate patient allocation to biopsy, and for 
      stratification into risk group categories, reducing overdiagnosis and 
      overtreatment.

TI  - Integrated Four Comparative-Omics Reveals the Mechanism of the Terpenoid 
      Biosynthesis in Two Different Overwintering Cryptomeria fortunei Phenotypes.
PG  - 740755
LID - 10.3389/fpls.2021.740755 [doi]
LID - 740755
AB  - Chinese cedar (Cryptomeria fortunei) is a tree species with important ornamental, 
      medicinal, and economic value. Terpenoids extracted from the essential oil of C. 
      fortunei needles have been considered valuable ingredients in the pharmaceutical 
      and cosmetic industries. However, the possible gene regulation mechanisms that 
      limit terpenoid biosynthesis in this genus are poorly understood. Here, we 
      adopted integrated metabolome analysis, transcriptome, small-RNA (sRNA), and 
      degradome sequencing to analyze the differences in terpenoid regulatory 
      mechanisms in two different overwintering C. fortunei phenotypes (wild-type and 
      an evergreen mutant). A total of 1447/6219 differentially synthesized metabolites 
      (DSMs)/unigenes (DEGs) were detected through metabolome/transcriptome analyses, 
      and these DSMs/DEGs were significantly enriched in flavonoid and diterpenoid 
      biosynthesis pathways. In C. fortunei needles, 587 microRNAs (miRNAs), including 
      67 differentially expressed miRNAs (DERs), were detected. Among them, 8346 
      targets of 571 miRNAs were predicted using degradome data, and a 72-miRNA-target 
      regulatory network involved in the metabolism of terpenoids and polyketides was 
      constructed. Forty-one targets were further confirmed to be involved in terpenoid 
      backbone and diterpenoid biosynthesis, and target analyses revealed that two 
      miRNAs (i.e., aly-miR168a-5p and aof-miR396a) may be related to the different 
      phenotypes and to differential regulation of diterpenoid biosynthesis. Overall, 
      these results reveal that C. fortunei plants with the evergreen mutation maintain 
      high terpenoid levels in winter through miRNA-target regulation, which provides a 
      valuable resource for essential oil-related bioengineering research.

TI  - Disruption of miRNA-mRNA Networks Defines Novel Molecular Signatures for Penile 
      Carcinogenesis.
LID - 10.3390/cancers13194745 [doi]
LID - 4745
AB  - Penile cancer (PeC) carcinogenesis is not fully understood, and no biomarkers are 
      reported in clinical practice. We aimed to investigate molecular signatures based 
      on miRNA and mRNA and perform an integrative analysis to identify molecular 
      drivers and pathways for PeC development. Affymetrix miRNA microarray was used to 
      identify differentially expressed miRNAs (DEmiRs) comparing 11 tumoral tissues 
      (TT) paired with non-neoplastic tissues (NNT) with further validation in an 
      independent cohort (n = 13). We also investigated the mRNA expression of 83 genes 
      in the total sample. Experimentally validated targets of DEmiRs, miRNA-mRNA 
      networks, and enriched pathways were evaluated in silico. Eight out of 69 DEmiRs 
      identified by microarray analysis were validated by qRT-PCR (miR-145-5p, 
      miR-432-5p, miR-487b-3p, miR-30a-5p, miR-200a-5p, miR-224-5p, miR-31-3p and 
      miR-31-5p). Furthermore, 37 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified 
      when comparing TT and NNT. We identified four downregulated DEmiRs (miR-30a-5p, 
      miR-432-5p, miR-487b-3p, and miR-145-5p) and six upregulated DEGs (IL1A, MCM2, 
      MMP1, MMP12, SFN and VEGFA) as potential biomarkers in PeC by their capacity of 
      discriminating TT and NNT with accuracy. The integration analysis showed eight 
      dysregulated miRNA-mRNA pairs in penile carcinogenesis. Taken together, our 
      findings contribute to a better understanding of the regulatory roles of miRNAs 
      and altered transcripts levels in penile carcinogenesis.

TI  - miRNA Profiling of Hungarian Regressive Wilms' Tumor Formalin-Fixed 
      Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE) Samples by Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain 
      Reaction (RT-PCR).
PG  - e932731

AB  - BACKGROUND Wilms' tumor is a common renal malignancy of early childhood with a 
      generally favorable prognosis depending upon histological subtype. It is becoming 
      increasingly clear that differences in miRNA (microRNA) expression signature 
      represent important clues helping us predict a tumor's response to chemotherapy. 
      In our study, we aimed to reveal miRNAs deregulated in regressive Wilms' tumors 
      from FFPE (formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded) samples, also showing whether such 
      samples are reliable miRNA sources in Wilms' tumor. MATERIAL AND METHODS Samples 
      from 8 Hungarian patients (3 males, 5 females, aged 1 to 7 years) were analyzed 
      by qRT-PCR (quantitative real-time PCR). A PCR array was used in a pilot 
      experiment, and selected miRNAs (miR-128-3p, miR-184, miR-194-5p, miR-203a) were 
      studied in the rest of the samples using individual primers. RESULTS miR-194-5p 
      was underexpressed in all tumor samples. miR-184 and miR-203a were underexpressed 
      in 7 cases, the exception being a case with a high ratio of necrotic blastemal 
      tissue. Results obtained with miR-128-3p are difficult to interpret due to 
      varying directions of expression changes. CONCLUSIONS We conclude that a 
      downregulation of miR-184, miR-194-5p, and miR-203a expression is observed in 
      both regressive and blastemal tumors, but larger-scale studies are needed to 
      confirm whether the degree of their underexpression correlates with the number of 
      blastemal elements in a sample. In most of our FFPE samples aged up to 9 years, 
      RNA extraction provided miRNA with quantity and quality sufficient for 
      qRT-PCR-based analysis, emphasizing the relevance of pathological archives as 
      miRNA sources in future studies.

TI  - Identification of fibronectin 1 (FN1) and complement component 3 (C3) as immune 
      infiltration-related biomarkers for diabetic nephropathy using integrated 
      bioinformatic analysis.
PG  - 5386-5401

AB  - Immune cell infiltration (ICI) plays a pivotal role in the development of 
      diabetic nephropathy (DN). Evidence suggests that immune-related genes play an 
      important role in the initiation of inflammation and the recruitment of immune 
      cells. However, the underlying mechanisms and immune-related biomarkers in DN 
      have not been elucidated. Therefore, this study aimed to explore immune-related 
      biomarkers in DN and the underlying mechanisms using bioinformatic approaches. In 
      this study, four DN glomerular datasets were downloaded, merged, and divided into 
      training and test cohorts. First, we identified 55 differentially expressed 
      immune-related genes; their biological functions were mainly enriched in 
      leukocyte chemotaxis and neutrophil migration. The CIBERSORT algorithm was then 
      used to evaluate the infiltrated immune cells; macrophages M1/M2, T cells CD8, 
      and resting mast cells were strongly associated with DN. The ICI-related gene 
      modules as well as 25 candidate hub genes were identified to construct a 
      protein-protein interactive network and conduct molecular complex detection using 
      the GOSemSim algorithm. Consequently, FN1, C3, and VEGFC were identified as 
      immune-related biomarkers in DN, and a related transcription factor-miRNA-target 
      network was constructed. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was 
      estimated in the test cohort; FN1 and C3 had large area under the curve values 
      (0.837 and 0.824, respectively). Clinical validation showed that FN1 and C3 were 
      negatively related to the glomerular filtration rate in patients with DN. Six 
      potential therapeutic small molecule compounds, such as calyculin, phenamil, and 
      clofazimine, were discovered in the connectivity map. In conclusion, FN1 and C3 
      are immune-related biomarkers of DN.

AB  - Rectal cancer is a life‚Äëthreatening disease worldwide. Chemotherapy resistance is 
      common in rectal adenocarcinoma patients and has unfavorable survival outcomes; 
      however, its related molecular mechanisms remain unknown. To identify genes 
      related to the initiation and progression of rectal adenocarcinoma, three 
      datasets were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. In total, 
      differentially expressed genes were analyzed from 294 tumor and 277 
      para-carcinoma samples from patients with rectal cancer. Gene Ontology and Kyoto 
      Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes functions were investigated. Cytoscape software 
      and MicroRNA Enrichment Turned Network were applied to construct a 
      protein-protein interaction network of the dependent hub genes and related 
      microRNAs. The Oncomine database was used to identify hub genes. Additionally, 
      Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis was applied to determine the RNA 
      expression level. Tumor immune infiltration was assessed using the Tumor Immune 
      Estimation Resource database. The expression profiles of hub genes between 
      stages, and their prognostic value, were also evaluated. During this study, data 
      from The Cancer Genome Atlas were utilized. In rectal adenocarcinoma, four hub 
      genes including CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL3, and GNG4 were highly expressed at the gene 
      and RNA levels. The expression of CXCL1, CXCL2, and CXCL3 was regulated by 
      has-miR-1-3p and had a strong positive correlation with macrophage and 
      neutrophil. CXCL2 and CXCL3 were differentially expressed at different tumor 
      stages. High expression levels of CXCL1 and CXCL3 predicted poor survival. In 
      conclusion, the CXCL1 and CXCL3 genes may have potential for prognosis and 
      molecular targeted therapy of rectal adenocarcinoma.

LID - 685938
AB  - While calpains have been implicated in neurogenesis for a long time, there is 
      still little information regarding the specific contributions of various isoforms 
      in this process. We took advantage of the availability of mutant mice with 
      complete deletion of calpain-1 to analyze its contribution to neurogenesis. We 
      first used the incorporation of BrdU in newly-generated cells in the subgranular 
      zone of the dentate gyrus to determine the role of calpain-1 deletion in neuronal 
      proliferation. Our results showed that the lack of calpain-1 decreased the rate 
      of cell proliferation in adult hippocampus. As previously shown, it also 
      decreased the long-term survival of newly-generated neurons. We also used data 
      from previously reported RNA and miRNA sequencing analyses to identify 
      differentially expressed genes in brain of calpain-1 knock-out mice related to 
      cell division, cell migration, cell proliferation and cell survival. A number of 
      differentially expressed genes were identified, which could play a significant 
      role in the changes in neurogenesis in calpain-1 knock out mice. The results 
      provide new information regarding the role of calpain-1 in neurogenesis and have 
      implications for better understanding the pathologies associated with calpain-1 
      mutations in humans.

TI  - Simulated Microgravity Effects on Human Adenocarcinoma Alveolar Epithelial Cells: 
      Characterization of Morphological, Functional, and Epigenetic Parameters.
LID - 10.3390/ijms22136951 [doi]
LID - 6951
AB  - BACKGROUND: In space, the reduction or loss of the gravity vector greatly affects 
      the interaction between cells. Since the beginning of the space age, microgravity 
      has been identified as an informative tool in biomedicine, including cancer 
      research. The A549 cell line is a hypotriploid human alveolar basal epithelial 
      cell line widely used as a model for lung adenocarcinoma. Microgravity has been 
      reported to interfere with mitochondrial activity, energy metabolism, cell 
      vitality and proliferation, chemosensitivity, invasion and morphology of cells 
      and organelles in various biological systems. Concerning lung cancer, several 
      studies have reported the ability of microgravity to modulate the carcinogenic 
      and metastatic process. To investigate these processes, A549 cells were exposed 
      to simulated microgravity (¬µG) for different time points. METHODS: We performed 
      cell cycle and proliferation assays, ultrastructural analysis of mitochondria 
      architecture, as well as a global analysis of miRNA modulated under ¬µG 
      conditions. RESULTS: The exposure of A549 cells to microgravity is accompanied by 
      the generation of polynucleated cells, cell cycle imbalance, growth inhibition, 
      and gross morphological abnormalities, the most evident are highly damaged 
      mitochondria. Global miRNA analysis defined a pool of miRNAs associated with ¬µG 
      solicitation mainly involved in cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and stress 
      response. To our knowledge, this is the first global miRNA analysis of A549 
      exposed to microgravity reported. Despite these results, it is not possible to 
      draw any conclusion concerning the ability of ¬µG to interfere with the 
      cancerogenic or the metastatic processes in A549 cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our results 
      provide evidence that mitochondria are strongly sensitive to ¬µG. We suggest that 
      mitochondria damage might in turn trigger miRNA modulation related to cell cycle 
      imbalance.

      Important Modules and Potential Drugs.

AB  - Ovarian cancer (OVC) is often diagnosed at the advanced stage resulting in a poor 
      overall outcome for the patient. The disease mechanisms, prognosis, and treatment 
      require imperative elucidation. A rank-based module-centric framework was 
      proposed to analyze the key modules related to the development, prognosis, and 
      treatment of OVC. The ovarian cancer cell line microarray dataset GSE43765 from 
      the Gene Expression Omnibus database was used to construct the reference modules 
      by weighted gene correlation network analysis. Twenty-three reference modules 
      were tested for stability and functionally annotated. Furthermore, to demonstrate 
      the utility of reference modules, two more OVC datasets were collected, and their 
      gene expression profiles were projected to the reference modules to generate a 
      module-level expression. An epithelial-mesenchymal transition module was 
      activated in OVC compared to the normal epithelium, and a pluripotency module was 
      activated in ovarian cancer stroma compared to ovarian cancer epithelium. Seven 
      differentially expressed modules were identified in OVC compared to the normal 
      ovarian epithelium, with five up-regulated, and two down-regulated. One module 
      was identified to be predictive of patient overall survival. Four modules were 
      enriched with SNP signals. Based on differentially expressed modules and hub 
      genes, five candidate drugs were screened. The hub genes of those modules merit 
      further investigation. We firstly propose the reference module-based analysis of 
      OVC. The utility of the analysis framework can be extended to transcriptome data 
      of other kinds of diseases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The spread of a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 
      2 (SARS-CoV-2) has affected both the public health and the global economy. The 
      current study was aimed at analysing the genetic sequence of this highly 
      contagious corona virus from an evolutionary perspective, comparing the genetic 
      variation features of different geographic strains, and identifying the key 
      miRNAs as well as their gene targets from the transcriptome data of infected lung 
      tissues. METHODS: A multilevel robust computational analysis was undertaken for 
      viral genetic sequence alignment, phylogram construction, genome-wide 
      transcriptome data interpretation of virus-infected lung tissues, miRNA mapping, 
      and functional biology networking. RESULTS: Our findings show both genetic 
      similarities as well as notable differences in the S protein length among 
      SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS viruses. All SARS-CoV-2 strains showed a high 
      genetic similarity with the parent Wuhan strain, but Saudi Arabian, South 
      African, USA, Russia and New Zealand strains carry 3 additional genetic 
      variations like P333L (RNA -dependant RNA polymerase), D614G (spike), and P4715L 
      (ORF1ab). The infected lung tissues demonstrated the upregulation of 282 (56.51%) 
      antiviral defensive response pathway genes and downregulation of 217 (43.48%) 
      genes involved in autophagy and lung repair pathways. By miRNA mapping, 4 key 
      miRNAs (hsa-miR-342-5p, hsa-miR-432-5p, hsa-miR-98-5p and hsa-miR-17-5p), 
      targeting multiple host genes (MYC, IL6, ICAM1 and VEGFA) as well as SARS-CoV2 
      gene (ORF1ab) were identified. CONCLUSION: Systems biology methods offer a new 
      perspective in understanding the molecular basis for the faster spread of 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection. The antiviral miRNAs identified in this study may aid in 
      the ongoing search for novel personalized therapeutic avenues for COVID patients.

AB  - Reduced inflammation, increased insulin sensitivity, and protection against 
      cancer are shared between humans and mice with GH/IGF1 deficiency. Beyond hormone 
      levels, miRNAs are important regulators of metabolic changes associated with 
      healthy aging. We hypothesized that GH deficiency in humans alters the abundance 
      of circulating miRNAs and that a subset of those miRNAs may overlap with those 
      found in GH-deficient mice. In this study, subjects with untreated congenital 
      isolated GH deficiency (IGHD; n¬†=¬†23) and control subjects matched by age and sex 
      (n¬†=¬†23) were recruited and serum was collected for miRNA sequencing. Serum 
      miRNAs from young (6¬†month) and old (22¬†month) Ames dwarf (df/df) mice with GH 
      deficiency and their WT littermates (n¬†=¬†5/age/genotype group) were used for 
      comparison. We observed 14 miRNAs regulated with a genotype by age effect and 19 
      miRNAs regulated with a genotype effect independent of age in serum of IGHD 
      subjects. These regulated miRNAs are known for targeting pathways associated with 
      longevity such as mTOR, insulin signaling, and FoxO. The aging function was 
      overrepresented in IGHD individuals, mediated by hsa-miR-31, hsa-miR-146b, 
      hsa-miR-30e, hsa-miR-100, hsa-miR-181b-2, hsa-miR-195, and hsa-miR-181b-1, which 
      target the FoxO and mTOR pathways. Intriguingly, miR-181b-5p, miR-361-3p, 
      miR-144-3p, and miR-155-5p were commonly regulated in the serum of humans and 
      GH-deficient mice. In vitro assays confirmed target genes for the main 
      up-regulated miRNAs, suggesting miRNAs regulated in IGHD individuals can regulate 
      the expression of age-related genes. These findings indicate that systemic miRNAs 
      regulated in IGHD individuals target pathways involved in aging in both humans 
      and mice.

AB  - The study of the miRNA cargo embedded in extracellular vesicles (EVs) released 
      from adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (ASC) preconditioned with IL-1Œ≤, 
      an inflammatory stimulus driving osteoarthritis (OA), along with EVs-cartilage 
      dynamic interaction represent poorly explored fields and are the purpose of the 
      present research. ASCs were isolated from subcutaneous adipose tissue and EVs 
      collected by ultracentrifugation. Shuttled miRNAs were scored by high-throughput 
      screening and analyzed through bioinformatics approach that predicted the 
      potentially modulated OA-related pathways. Fluorescently labeled EVs 
      incorporation into OA cartilage explants was followed in vitro by time-lapse 
      coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering; second harmonic generation and two-photon 
      excited fluorescence. After IL-1Œ≤ preconditioning, 7 miRNA were up-regulated, 4 
      down-regulated, 37 activated and 17 silenced. Bioinformatics allowed to identify 
      miRNAs and target genes mainly involved in Wnt, Notch, TGFŒ≤ and Indian hedgehog 
      (IHH) pathways, cartilage homeostasis, immune/inflammatory responses, cell 
      senescence and autophagy. As well, ASC-EVs steadily diffuse in cartilage cells 
      and matrix, reaching a plateau 16 h after administration. Overall, ASCs 
      preconditioned with IL-1Œ≤ allows secretion of EVs embedded with a 
      chondro-protective miRNA cargo, able to fast penetrate in collagen-rich areas of 
      cartilage with tissue saturation in a day. Further functional studies exploring 
      the EVs dose-effects are needed to achieve clinical relevance.

AB  - The information on the genotype-phenotype relationship in Turner Syndrome (TS) is 
      inadequate because very few specific candidate genes are linked to its clinical 
      features. We used the microarray data of TS to identify the key regulatory genes 
      implicated with TS through a network approach. The causative factors of two 
      common co-morbidities, Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) and Recurrent Miscarriages 
      (RM), in the Turner population, are expected to be different from that of the 
      general population. Through microarray analysis, we identified nine signature 
      genes of T2DM and three signature genes of RM in TS. The power-law distribution 
      analysis showed that the TS network carries scale-free hierarchical fractal 
      attributes. Through local-community-paradigm (LCP) estimation we find that a 
      strong LCP is also maintained which means that networks are dynamic and 
      heterogeneous. We identified nine key regulators which serve as the backbone of 
      the TS network. Furthermore, we recognized eight interologs functional in seven 
      different organisms from lower to higher levels. Overall, these results offer few 
      key regulators and essential genes that we envisage have potential as therapeutic 
      targets for the TS in the future and the animal models studied here may prove 
      useful in the validation of such targets.

AB  - Which genes, gene sets or pathways are regulated by certain miRNAs? Which miRNAs 
      regulate a particular target gene or target pathway in a certain physiological 
      context? Answering such common research questions can be time consuming and labor 
      intensive. Especially for researchers without computational experience, the 
      integration of different data sources, selection of the right parameters and 
      concise visualization can be demanding. A comprehensive analysis should be 
      central to present adequate answers to complex biological questions. With 
      miRTargetLink 2.0, we develop an all-in-one solution for human, mouse and rat 
      miRNA networks. Users input in the unidirectional search mode either a single 
      gene, gene set or gene pathway, alternatively a single miRNA, a set of miRNAs or 
      an miRNA pathway. Moreover, genes and miRNAs can jointly be provided to the tool 
      in the bidirectional search mode. For the selected entities, interaction graphs 
      are generated from different data sources and dynamically presented. Connected 
      application programming interfaces (APIs) to the tailored enrichment tools miEAA 
      and GeneTrail facilitate downstream analysis of pathways and context-annotated 
      categories of network nodes. MiRTargetLink 2.0 is freely accessible at 
      https://www.ccb.uni-saarland.de/mirtargetlink2.

AB  - COVID-19 has currently become the biggest challenge in the world. There is still 
      no specific medicine for COVID-19, which leaves a critical gap for the 
      identification of new drug candidates for the disease. Recent studies have 
      reported that the small-molecule enoxacin exerts an antiviral activity by 
      enhancing the RNAi pathway. The aim of this study is to analyze if enoxacin can 
      exert anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects. We exploit multiple computational tools and 
      databases to examine (i) whether the RNAi mechanism, as the target pathway of 
      enoxacin, could act on the SARS-CoV-2 genome, and (ii) microRNAs induced by 
      enoxacin might directly silence viral components as well as the host cell 
      proteins mediating the viral entry and replication. We find that the RNA genome 
      of SARS-CoV-2 might be a suitable substrate for DICER activity. We also highlight 
      several enoxacin-enhanced microRNAs which could target SARS-CoV-2 components, 
      pro-inflammatory cytokines, host cell components facilitating viral replication, 
      and transcription factors enriched in lung stem cells, thereby promoting their 
      differentiation and lung regeneration. Finally, our analyses identify several 
      enoxacin-targeted regulatory modules that were critically associated with 
      exacerbation of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Overall, our analysis suggests that 
      enoxacin could be a promising candidate for COVID-19 treatment through enhancing 
      the RNAi pathway.

TI  - Circulating miRNAs Act as Diagnostic Biomarkers for Bladder Cancer in Urine.
LID - 10.3390/ijms22084278 [doi]
LID - 4278
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) can be secreted into body fluids and have thus been reported 
      as a new type of cancer biomarker. This study aimed to determine whether urinary 
      miRNAs act as noninvasive biomarkers for diagnosing bladder cancer. Small RNA 
      profiles from urine were generated for 10 patients with bladder cancer and 10 
      healthy controls by using next-generation sequencing. We identified 50 urinary 
      miRNAs that were differentially expressed in bladder cancer compared with 
      controls, comprising 44 upregulated and six downregulated miRNAs. Pathway 
      enrichment analysis revealed that the biological role of these differentially 
      expressed miRNAs might be involved in cancer-associated signaling pathways. 
      Further analysis of the public database revealed that let-7b-5p, miR-149-5p, 
      miR-146a-5p, miR-193a-5p, and miR-423-5p were significantly increased in bladder 
      cancer compared with corresponding adjacent normal tissues. Furthermore, high 
      miR-149-5p and miR-193a-5p expression was significantly correlated with poor 
      overall survival in patients with bladder cancer. The qRT-PCR approach revealed 
      that the expression levels of let-7b-5p, miR-149-5p, miR-146a-5p and miR-423-5p 
      were significantly increased in the urine of patients with bladder cancer 
      compared with those of controls. Although our results indicated that urinary 
      miRNAs are promising biomarkers for diagnosing bladder cancer, this must be 
      validated in larger cohorts in the future.

AB  - Rod and cone photoreceptors differ in their shape, photopigment expression, 
      synaptic connection patterns, light sensitivity, and distribution across the 
      retina. Although rods greatly outnumber cones, human vision is mostly dependent 
      on cone photoreceptors since cones are essential for our sharp visual acuity and 
      color discrimination. In humans and other primates, the fovea centralis (fovea), 
      a specialized region of the central retina, contains the highest density of 
      cones. Despite the vast importance of the fovea for human vision, the molecular 
      mechanisms guiding the development of this region are largely unknown. MicroRNAs 
      (miRNAs) are small post-transcriptional regulators known to orchestrate 
      developmental transitions and cell fate specification in the retina. Here, we 
      have characterized the transcriptional landscape of the developing rhesus monkey 
      retina. Our data indicates that non-human primate fovea development is 
      significantly accelerated compared to the equivalent retinal region at the other 
      side of the optic nerve head, as described previously. Notably, we also identify 
      several miRNAs differentially expressed in the presumptive fovea, including 
      miR-15b-5p, miR-342-5p, miR-30b-5p, miR-103-3p, miR-93-5p as well as the miRNA 
      cluster miR-183/-96/-182. Interestingly, miR-342-5p is enriched in the nasal 
      primate retina and in the peripheral developing mouse retina, while miR-15b is 
      enriched in the temporal primate retina and increases over time in the mouse 
      retina in a central-to-periphery gradient. Together our data constitutes the 
      first characterization of the developing rhesus monkey retinal miRNome and 
      provides novel datasets to attain a more comprehensive understanding of foveal 
      development.

      Treated Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients.

AB  - Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a complex disease with a wide range of underlying 
      susceptibility factors. Recently, dysregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) in RA have 
      been reported in several immune cell types from blood. However, B cells have not 
      been studied in detail yet. Given the autoimmune nature of RA with the presence 
      of autoantibodies, CD19+ B cells are a key cell type in RA pathogenesis and 
      alterations in CD19+ B cell subpopulations have been observed in patient blood. 
      Therefore, we aimed to reveal the global miRNA repertoire and to analyze miRNA 
      expression profile differences in homogenous RA patient phenotypes in 
      blood-derived CD19+ B cells. Small RNA sequencing was performed on CD19+ B cells 
      of newly diagnosed untreated RA patients (n=10), successfully methotrexate (MTX) 
      treated RA patients in remission (MTX treated RA patients, n=18) and healthy 
      controls (n=9). The majority of miRNAs was detected across all phenotypes. 
      However, significant expression differences between MTX treated RA patients and 
      controls were observed for 27 miRNAs, while no significant differences were seen 
      between the newly diagnosed patients and controls. Several of the differentially 
      expressed miRNAs were previously found to be dysregulated in RA including 
      miR-223-3p, miR-486-3p and miR-23a-3p. MiRNA target enrichment analysis, using 
      the differentially expressed miRNAs and miRNA-target interactions from miRTarBase 
      as input, revealed enriched target genes known to play important roles in B cell 
      activation, differentiation and B cell receptor signaling, such as STAT3, PRDM1 
      and PTEN. Interestingly, many of those genes showed a high degree of correlated 
      expression in CD19+ B cells in contrast to other immune cell types. Our results 
      suggest important regulatory functions of miRNAs in blood-derived CD19+ B cells 
      of MTX treated RA patients and motivate for future studies investigating the 
      interactive mechanisms between miRNA and gene targets, as well as the possible 
      predictive power of miRNAs for RA treatment response.

AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNA molecules that act as major regulators 
      of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. As the potential 
      applications of miRNAs in the diagnosis and treatment of human diseases have 
      become more evident, many studies of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) have 
      focused on the systemic identification and quantification of miRNAs in biofluids 
      and myocardial tissues. HCM is a hereditary cardiomyopathy caused by mutations in 
      genes encoding proteins of the sarcomere. Despite overall improvements in 
      survival, progression to heart failure, stroke, and sudden cardiac death remain 
      prominent features of living with HCM. Several miRNAs have been shown to be 
      promising biomarkers of HCM; however, there are many challenges to ensuring the 
      validity, consistency, and reproducibility of these biomarkers for clinical use. 
      In particular, miRNA testing may be limited by pre-analytical and analytical 
      caveats, making our interpretation of results challenging. Such factors that may 
      affect miRNA testing include sample type selection, hemolysis, platelet 
      activation, and renal dysfunction. Therefore, researchers should be careful when 
      developing appropriate standards for the design of miRNA profiling studies in 
      order to ensure that all results provided are both accurate and reliable. In this 
      review, we discuss the application of miRNAs as biomarkers for HCM.

AB  - Host¬†innate¬†immunity¬†is the major player against continuous microbial¬†infection. 
      Various pathogenic bacteria adopt the strategies to evade the¬†immunity¬†and show 
      resistance toward the various established therapies. Despite the advent of many 
      antibiotics for¬†bacterial¬†infections, there is a¬†substantial need for the 
      host-directed therapies (HDTs) to combat the¬†infection. HDTs are recently being 
      adopted to be useful in eradicating intracellular¬†bacterial¬†infection. Changing 
      the¬†innate¬†immune responses of the host cells alters pathogen's ability to reside 
      inside the cell. MicroRNAs are the small non-coding endogenous molecules and 
      post-transcriptional regulators to target the 3'UTR of the messenger RNA. They 
      are reported to modulate the host's immune responses¬†during¬†bacterial¬†infections. 
      Exploiting microRNAs as a therapeutic candidate in HDTs 
      upon¬†bacterial¬†infection¬†is still in its infancy. Here, initially, we¬†re-analyzed 
      the publicly available transcriptomic dataset of macrophages, infected 
      with¬†different pathogenic bacteria and identified significant genes and microRNAs 
      common to the differential infections.¬†We thus identified¬†and miR-30e-5p, to be 
      upregulated in different bacterial¬†infections which enhances¬†innate¬†immunity¬†to 
      combat¬†bacterial¬†replication by targeting key negative regulators such as SOCS1 
      and SOCS3 of¬†innate¬†immune signaling pathways. Therefore, we propose miR-30e-5p 
      as one of the potential candidates to be considered for additional clinical 
      validation toward HDTs.

AB  - The identification of microRNAs in biological fluids for diagnosis and prognosis 
      is receiving great attention in the field of multiple sclerosis (MS) research but 
      it is still in its infancy. In the present study, we observed in a large sample 
      of MS patients that let-7b-5p levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were highly 
      correlated with a number of microRNAs implicated in MS, as well as with a variety 
      of inflammation-related protein factors, showing specific expression patterns 
      coherent with let-7b-5p-mediated regulation. Additionally, we found that the CSF 
      let-7b-5p levels were significantly reduced in patients with the progressive MS 
      compared to patients with relapsing-remitting MS and were negatively correlated 
      with characteristic hallmark processes of the two phases of the disease. Indeed, 
      in the non-progressive phase, let-7b-5p inversely associated with both central 
      and peripheral inflammation; whereas, in progressive MS, the CSF levels of 
      let-7b-5p negatively correlated with clinical disability at disease onset and 
      after a follow-up period. Overall, our results uncovered, by the means of a 
      multidisciplinary approach and multiple statistical analyses, a new possible 
      pleiotropic action of let-7b-5p in MS, with potential utility as a biomarker of 
      MS course.

AB  - Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML), a rare 
      myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm of early childhood, is characterized 
      by clonal growth of RAS signaling addicted stem cells. JMML subtypes are defined 
      by specific RAS pathway mutations and display distinct gene, microRNA (miRNA) and 
      long non-coding RNA expression profiles. Here we zoom in on circular RNAs 
      (circRNAs), molecules that, when abnormally expressed, may participate in 
      malignant deviation of cellular processes. CirComPara software was used to 
      annotate and quantify circRNAs in RNA-seq data of a "discovery cohort" comprising 
      19 JMML patients and 3 healthy donors (HD). In an independent set of 12 JMML 
      patients and 6 HD, expression of 27 circRNAs was analyzed by qRT-PCR. 
      CircRNA-miRNA-gene networks were reconstructed using circRNA function prediction 
      and gene expression data. We identified 119 circRNAs dysregulated in JMML and 59 
      genes showing an imbalance of the circular and linear products. Our data 
      indicated also circRNA expression differences among molecular subgroups of JMML. 
      Validation of a set of deregulated circRNAs in an independent cohort of JMML 
      patients confirmed the down-regulation of circOXNAD1 and circATM, and a marked 
      up-regulation of circLYN, circAFF2, and circMCTP1. A new finding in JMML links 
      up-regulated circMCTP1 with known tumor suppressor miRNAs. This and other 
      predicted interactions with miRNAs connect dysregulated circRNAs to regulatory 
      networks. In conclusion, this study provides insight into the circRNAome of JMML 
      and paves the path to elucidate new molecular disease mechanisms putting forward 
      circMCTP1 up-regulation as a robust example.

TI  - The micro-RNA content of unsorted cryopreserved bovine sperm and its relation to 
      the fertility of sperm after sex-sorting.
PG  - 30

AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of sex-sorted sperm in cattle assisted reproduction is 
      constantly increasing. However, sperm fertility can substantially differ between 
      unsorted (conventional) and sex-sorted semen batches of the same sire. Sperm 
      microRNAs (miRNA) have been suggested as promising biomarkers of bull fertility 
      the last years. In this study, we hypothesized that the miRNA profile of 
      cryopreserved conventional sperm is related to bull fertility after artificial 
      insemination with X-bearing sperm. For this purpose, we analyzed the miRNA 
      profile of 18 conventional sperm samples obtained from nine high- (HF) and nine 
      low-fertility (LF) bulls that were contemporaneously used to produce conventional 
      and sex-sorted semen batches. The annual 56-day non-return rate for each semen 
      type (NRR(conv) and NRR(ss), respectively) was recorded for each bull. RESULTS: 
      In total, 85 miRNAs were detected. MiR-34b-3p and miR-100-5p were the two most 
      highly expressed miRNAs with their relative abundance reaching 30% in total. 
      MiR-10a-5p and miR-9-5p were differentially expressed in LF and HF samples (false 
      discovery rate‚Äâ<‚Äâ10%). The expression levels of miR-9-5p, miR-34c, miR-423-5p, 
      miR-449a, miR-5193-5p, miR-1246, miR-2483-5p, miR-92a, miR-21-5p were 
      significantly correlated to NRR(ss) but not to NRR(conv). Based on robust 
      regression analysis, miR-34c, miR-7859 and miR-342 showed the highest 
      contribution to the prediction of NRR(ss). CONCLUSIONS: A set of miRNAs detected 
      in conventionally produced semen batches were linked to the fertilizing potential 
      of bovine sperm after sex-sorting. These miRNAs should be further evaluated as 
      potential biomarkers of a sire's suitability for the production of sex-sorted 
      sperm.

TI  - Identification of the 3-lncRNA Signature as a Prognostic Biomarker for Colorectal 
      Cancer.
LID - 10.3390/ijms21249359 [doi]
LID - 9359
AB  - Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignant carcinomas in the 
      world, and metastasis is the main cause of CRC-related death. However, the 
      molecular network involved in CRC metastasis remains poorly understood. Long 
      noncoding RNA (lncRNA) plays a vital role in tumorigenesis and may act as a 
      competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) to affect the expression of mRNA by suppressing 
      miRNA function. In this study, we identified 628 mRNAs, 144 lncRNAs, and 25 
      miRNAs that are differentially expressed (DE) in metastatic CRC patients compared 
      with nonmetastatic CRC patients from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. 
      Functional enrichment analyses confirmed that the identified DE mRNAs are 
      extensively involved in CRC tumorigenesis and migration. By bioinformatics 
      analysis, we constructed a metastasis-associated ceRNA network for CRC that 
      includes 28 mRNAs, 12 lncRNAs, and 15 miRNAs. We then performed multivariate Cox 
      regression analysis on the ceRNA-related DE lncRNAs and identified a 3-lncRNA 
      signature (LINC00114, LINC00261, and HOTAIR) with the greatest prognostic value 
      for CRC. Clinical feature analysis and functional enrichment analysis further 
      proved that these three lncRNAs are involved in CRC tumorigenesis. Finally, we 
      used Transwell, Cell Counting Kit (CCK)-8, and colony formation assays to clarify 
      that the inhibition of LINC00114 promotes the migratory, invasive, and 
      proliferative abilities of CRC cells. The results of the luciferase assay suggest 
      that LINC00114 is the direct target of miR-135a, which also verified the ceRNA 
      network. In summary, this study provides a metastasis-associated ceRNA network 
      for CRC and suggests that the 3-lncRNA signature may be a useful candidate for 
      the diagnosis and prognosis of CRC.

AB  - Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are stable RNA molecules that can drive cancer through 
      interactions with microRNAs and proteins and by the expression of circRNA encoded 
      peptides. The aim of the study was to define the circRNA landscape and potential 
      impact in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Analysis by CirComPara of 
      RNA-sequencing data from 25 T-ALL patients, immature, HOXA overexpressing, TLX1, 
      TLX3, TAL1, or LMO2 rearranged, and from thymocyte populations of human healthy 
      donors disclosed 68‚Äâ554 circRNAs. Study of the top 3447 highly expressed circRNAs 
      identified 944 circRNAs with significant differential expression between 
      malignant T cells and normal counterparts, with most circRNAs displaying 
      increased expression in T-ALL. Next, we defined subtype-specific circRNA 
      signatures in molecular genetic subgroups of human T-ALL. In particular, 
      circZNF609, circPSEN1, circKPNA5, and circCEP70 were upregulated in immature, 
      circTASP1, circZBTB44, and circBACH1 in TLX3, circHACD1, and circSTAM in HOXA, 
      circCAMSAP1 in TLX1, and circCASC15 in TAL-LMO. Backsplice sequences of 14 
      circRNAs ectopically expressed in T-ALL were confirmed, and overexpression of 
      circRNAs in T-ALL with specific oncogenic lesions was substantiated by 
      quantification in a panel of 13 human cell lines. An oncogenic role of circZNF609 
      in T-ALL was indicated by decreased cell viability upon silencing in vitro. 
      Furthermore, functional predictions identified circRNA-microRNA gene axes 
      informing modes of circRNA impact in molecular subtypes of human T-ALL.

TI  - NGF/TRKA Decrease miR-145-5p Levels in Epithelial Ovarian Cancer Cells.
LID - 10.3390/ijms21207657 [doi]
LID - 7657
AB  - Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) and its high-affinity receptor tropomyosin receptor 
      kinase A (TRKA) increase their expression during the progression of epithelial 
      ovarian cancer (EOC), promoting cell proliferation and angiogenesis through 
      several oncogenic proteins, such as c-MYC and vascular endothelial growth factor 
      (VEGF). The expression of these proteins is controlled by microRNAs (miRs), such 
      as miR-145, whose dysregulation has been related to cancer. The aims of this work 
      were to evaluate in EOC cells whether NGF/TRKA decreases miR-145 levels, and the 
      effect of miR-145 upregulation. The levels of miR-145-5p were assessed by qPCR in 
      ovarian biopsies and ovarian cell lines (human ovarian surface epithelial cells 
      (HOSE), A2780 and SKOV3) stimulated with NGF. Overexpression of miR-145 in 
      ovarian cells was used to evaluate cell proliferation, migration, invasion, c-MYC 
      and VEGF protein levels, as well as tumor formation and metastasis in vivo. In 
      EOC samples, miR-145-5p levels were lower than in epithelial ovarian tumors. 
      Overexpression of miR-145 decreased cell proliferation, migration and invasion of 
      EOC cells, changes that were concomitant with the decrease in c-MYC and VEGF 
      protein levels. We observed decreased tumor formation and suppressed metastasis 
      behavior in mice injected with EOC cells that overexpressed miR-145. As expected, 
      ovarian cell lines stimulated with NGF diminished miR-145-5p transcription and 
      abundance. These results suggest that the tumoral effects of NGF/TRKA depend on 
      the regulation of miR-145-5p levels in EOC cells, and that its upregulation could 
      be used as a possible therapeutic strategy for EOC.

AB  - Multipotent stem cells (MSCs) are used in various therapeutic applications based 
      on their paracrine secretion activity. Here, we set out to identify and 
      characterize the paracrine factors released during osteoblastogenesis, with a 
      special focus on small non-coding RNAs released in extracellular vesicles (EVs). 
      Bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) and adipose stem cells (ASCs) from healthy human 
      donors were used as representatives of MSCs. We isolated EVs secreted before and 
      after induction of osteoblastic differentiation and found that the EVs contained 
      a specific subset of microRNAs (miRNAs) and tRNA-derived small RNAs (tsRNA) 
      compared to their parental cells. Osteoblastic differentiation had a larger 
      effect on the small RNA profile of BMSC-EVs relative to ASC-EVs. Our data showed 
      that EVs from different MSC origin exhibited distinct expression profiles of 
      small RNA profiles when undergoing osteoblastogenesis, a factor that should be 
      taken into consideration for stem cell therapy.

AB  - miRNAs are important regulators of gene expression that play a key role in many 
      biological processes. High-throughput techniques allow researchers to discover 
      and characterize large sets of miRNAs, and enrichment analysis tools are becoming 
      increasingly important in decoding which miRNAs are implicated in biological 
      processes. Enrichment analysis of miRNA targets is the standard technique for 
      functional analysis, but this approach carries limitations and bias; alternatives 
      are currently being proposed, based on direct and curated annotations. In this 
      review, we describe the two workflows of miRNAs enrichment analysis, based on 
      target gene or miRNA annotations, highlighting statistical tests, software tools, 
      up-to-date databases, and functional annotations resources in the study of 
      metazoan miRNAs.

TI  - miRNet 2.0: network-based visual analytics for miRNA functional analysis and 
      systems biology.
PG  - W244-W251
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkaa467 [doi]
AB  - miRNet is an easy-to-use, web-based platform designed to help elucidate microRNA 
      (miRNA) functions by integrating users'¬†data with existing knowledge via 
      network-based visual analytics. Since its first release in 2016, miRNet has been 
      accessed by >20 000 researchers worldwide, with ‚àº100 users on a daily basis. 
      While version 1.0 was focused primarily on miRNA-target gene interactions, it has 
      become clear that in order to obtain a global view of miRNA functions, it is 
      necessary to bring other important players into the context during analysis. 
      Driven by this concept, in miRNet version 2.0, we have (i) added support for 
      transcription factors (TFs) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that 
      affect miRNAs, miRNA-binding sites or target genes, whilst also greatly increased 
      (>5-fold) the underlying knowledgebases of miRNAs, ncRNAs and disease 
      associations; (ii) implemented new functions to allow creation and visual 
      exploration of multipartite networks, with enhanced support for in situ 
      functional analysis and (iii) revamped the web interface, optimized the workflow, 
      and introduced microservices and web application programming interface (API) to 
      sustain high-performance, real-time data analysis. The underlying R package is 
      also released in tandem with version 2.0 to allow more flexible data analysis for 
      R programmers. The miRNet 2.0 website is freely available at 
      https://www.mirnet.ca.

TI  - Identification of Long Noncoding RNA Associated ceRNA Networks in Rosacea.
PG  - 9705950
LID - 10.1155/2020/9705950 [doi]
LID - 9705950
AB  - Rosacea is a chronic and relapsing inflammatory cutaneous disorder with highly 
      variable prevalence worldwide that adversely affects the health of patients and 
      their quality of life. However, the molecular characterization of each rosacea 
      subtype is still unclear. Furthermore, little is known about the role of long 
      noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the pathogenesis or regulatory processes of this 
      disorder. In the current study, we established lncRNA-mRNA coexpression networks 
      for three rosacea subtypes (erythematotelangiectatic, papulopustular, and 
      phymatous) and performed their functional enrichment analyses using Gene 
      Onotology, KEGG, GSEA, and WGCNA. Compared to the control group, 13 
      differentially expressed lncRNAs and 525 differentially expressed mRNAs were 
      identified in the three rosacea subtypes. The differentially expressed genes 
      identified were enriched in four signaling pathways and the GO terms found were 
      associated with leukocyte migration. In addition, we found nine differentially 
      expressed lncRNAs in all three rosacea subtype-related networks, including NEAT1 
      and HOTAIR, which may play important roles in the pathology of rosacea. Our study 
      provided novel insights into lncRNA-mRNA coexpression networks to discover the 
      molecular mechanisms involved in rosacea development that can be used as future 
      targets of rosacea diagnosis, prevention, and treatment.

TI  - The Oviductal Extracellular Vesicles' RNA Cargo Regulates the Bovine Embryonic 
      Transcriptome.
LID - 10.3390/ijms21041303 [doi]
LID - 1303
AB  - Oviductal extracellular vesicles (oEVs) are emerging as key players in the 
      gamete/embryo-oviduct interactions that contribute to successful pregnancy. 
      Various positive effects of oEVs on gametes and early embryos have been found in 
      vitro. To determine whether these effects are associated with changes of 
      embryonic gene expression, the transcriptomes of embryos supplemented with bovine 
      fresh (FeEVs) or frozen (FoEVs) oEVs during in vitro culture compared to controls 
      without oEVs were analyzed by low-input RNA sequencing. Analysis of RNA-seq data 
      revealed 221 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between FoEV treatment and 
      control, 67 DEGs for FeEV and FoEV treatments, and minor differences between FeEV 
      treatment and control (28 DEGs). An integrative analysis of mRNAs and miRNAs 
      contained in oEVs obtained in a previous study with embryonic mRNA alterations 
      pointed to direct effects of oEV cargo on embryos (1) by increasing the 
      concentration of delivered transcripts; (2) by translating delivered mRNAs to 
      proteins that regulate embryonic gene expression; and (3) by oEV-derived miRNAs 
      which downregulate embryonic mRNAs or modify gene expression in other ways. Our 
      study provided the first high-throughput analysis of the embryonic transcriptome 
      regulated by oEVs, increasing our knowledge on the impact of oEVs on the embryo 
      and revealing the oEV RNA components that potentially regulate embryonic 
      development.
