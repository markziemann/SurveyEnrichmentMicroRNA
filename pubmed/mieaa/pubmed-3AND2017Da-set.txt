AB  - Extracellular vesicles (EVs) play a vital role in normal lung physiology to 
      maintain homeostasis in the airways via intercellular communication. EVs include 
      exosomes and microvesicles, and are characterized by their phospholipid bilayers. 
      EVs have been recognized as novel circulating biomarkers of disease, which are 
      released by different cell types. In this study, we used different EV isolation 
      and purification methods to characterize the plasma-derived EV miRNAs from 
      non-smokers, smokers and patients with COPD. A small RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) 
      approach was adapted to identify novel circulating EV miRNAs. We found that 
      plasma-derived EVs from non-smokers, smokers and patients with COPD vary in their 
      size, concentration, distribution and phenotypic characteristics as confirmed by 
      nanoparticle tracking analysis, transmission electron microscopy, and immunoblot 
      analysis of EV surface markers. RNA-seq analysis confirmed the most abundant 
      types of small RNAs, such as miRNAs, tRNAs, piRNAs snRNAs, snoRNAs and other 
      biotypes in plasma-derived EVs. We mainly focused on miRNAs as novel biomarkers 
      in smokers and patients with COPD for further analysis. Differential expression 
      by DESeq2 identified distinct miRNA profiles (up-regulated: miR-22-3p, 
      miR-99a-5p, miR-151a-5p, miR-320b, miR-320d; and down-regulated: miR-335-5p, 
      miR-628-3p, miR-887-5p and miR-937-3p) in COPD versus smokers or non-smokers in a 
      pairwise comparison. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of differentially 
      expressed miRNAs revealed the top pathways, gene ontology and diseases associated 
      with smokers and patients with COPD. We selectively validated miRNAs in EVs 
      isolated from BEAS-2B cells treated with cigarette smoke extract by quantitative 
      PCR analysis. For the first time, we report that plasma-derived EV miRNAs are 
      novel circulating pulmonary disease biomarkers. Thus, molecular profiling of EV 
      miRNAs has great translational potential for the development of biomarkers that 
      may be used in the diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutics of COPD.

AB  - Musical training and performance require precise integration of multisensory and 
      motor centres of the human brain and can be regarded as an epigenetic modifier of 
      brain functions. Numerous studies have identified structural and functional 
      differences between the brains of musicians and non-musicians and superior 
      cognitive functions in musicians. Recently, music-listening and performance has 
      also been shown to affect the regulation of several genes, many of which were 
      identified in songbird singing. MicroRNAs affect gene regulation and studying 
      their expression may give new insights into the epigenetic effect of music. Here, 
      we studied the effect of 2 hours of classical music-performance on the peripheral 
      blood microRNA expressions in professional musicians with respect to a control 
      activity without music for the same duration. As detecting transcriptomic changes 
      in the functional human brain remains a challenge for geneticists, we used 
      peripheral blood to study music-performance induced microRNA changes and 
      interpreted the results in terms of potential effects on brain function, based on 
      the current knowledge about the microRNA function in blood and brain. We 
      identified significant (FDR <0.05) up-regulation of five microRNAs; hsa-miR-3909, 
      hsa-miR-30d-5p, hsa-miR-92a-3p, hsa-miR-222-3p and hsa-miR-30a-5p; and 
      down-regulation of two microRNAs; hsa-miR-6803-3p and hsa-miR-1249-3p. 
      hsa-miR-222-3p and hsa-miR-92a-3p putatively target FOXP2, which was found 
      down-regulated by microRNA regulation in songbird singing. miR-30d and miR-222 
      corroborate microRNA response observed in zebra finch song-listening/learning. 
      miR-222 is induced by ERK cascade, which is important for memory formation, motor 
      neuron functions and neuronal plasticity. miR-222 is also activated by FOSL1, an 
      immediate early gene from the FOS family of transcriptional regulators which are 
      activated by auditory-motor stimuli. miR-222 and miR-92 promote neurite outgrowth 
      by negatively regulating the neuronal growth inhibitor, PTEN, and by activating 
      CREB expression and phosphorylation. The up-regulation of microRNAs previously 
      found to be regulators of auditory and nervous system functions (miR-30d, miR-92a 
      and miR-222) is indicative of the sensory perception processes associated with 
      music-performance. Akt signalling pathway which has roles in cell survival, cell 
      differentiation, activation of CREB signalling and dopamine transmission was one 
      of the functions regulated by the up-regulated microRNAs; in accordance with 
      functions identified from songbird learning. The up-regulated microRNAs were also 
      found to be regulators of apoptosis, suggesting repression of apoptotic 
      mechanisms in connection with music-performance. Furthermore, comparative 
      analyses of the target genes of differentially expressed microRNAs with that of 
      the song-responsive microRNAs in songbirds suggest convergent regulatory 
      mechanisms underlying auditory perception.

AB  - MicroRNA regulation of key biological and developmental pathways is a rapidly 
      expanding area of research, accompanied by vast amounts of experimental data. 
      This data, however, is not widely available in bioinformatic resources, making it 
      difficult for researchers to find and analyze microRNA-related experimental data 
      and define further research projects. We are addressing this problem by providing 
      two new bioinformatics data sets that contain experimentally verified functional 
      information for mammalian microRNAs involved in cardiovascular-relevant, and 
      other, processes. To date, our resource provides over 4400 Gene Ontology 
      annotations associated with over 500 microRNAs from human, mouse, and rat and 
      over 2400 experimentally validated microRNA:target interactions. We illustrate 
      how this resource can be used to create microRNA-focused interaction networks 
      with a biological context using the known biological role of microRNAs and the 
      mRNAs they regulate, enabling discovery of associations between gene products, 
      biological pathways and, ultimately, diseases. This data will be crucial in 
      advancing the field of microRNA bioinformatics and will establish consistent data 
      sets for reproducible functional analysis of microRNAs across all biological 
      research areas.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Preterm birth remains a major public health issue affecting 10% of 
      all pregnancies and increases risks of neonatal morbidity and mortality. 
      Approximately 50% to 60% of preterm births are spontaneous, resulting from 
      preterm premature rupture of membranes or preterm labor. The pathogenesis of 
      spontaneous preterm birth is incompletely understood, and prediction of preterm 
      birth remains elusive. Accurate prediction of preterm birth would reduce infant 
      morbidity and mortality through targeted patient referral to hospitals equipped 
      to care for preterm infants. Two previous studies have analyzed cervical 
      microRNAs in association with spontaneous preterm birth and the length of 
      gestation, but the extent to which microRNAs serve as predictive biomarkers 
      remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine associations between 
      cervical microRNA expression and spontaneous preterm birth, with the specific 
      goal of identifying a subset of microRNAs that predict spontaneous preterm birth. 
      STUDY DESIGN: We performed a prospective, nested, case-control study of 25 cases 
      with spontaneous preterm birth and 49 term controls. Controls were matched to 
      cases in a 2:1 ratio on the basis of age, parity, and self-identified race. 
      Cervical swabs were collected at a mean gestational age of 17.1 (4.8) weeks of 
      gestation, and microRNAs were analyzed using a quantitative polymerase chain 
      reaction array. Normalized microRNA expression was compared between cases and 
      controls, and a false discovery rate of 0.2 was applied to account for multiple 
      comparisons. Histopathologic analysis of slides of cervical swab samples was 
      performed to quantify leukocyte burden for adjustment in conditional regression 
      models. We explored the use of Relief-based unsupervised identification of top 
      microRNAs and support vector machines to predict spontaneous preterm birth. We 
      performed microRNA enrichment analysis to explore potential biologic targets and 
      pathways in which up-regulated microRNAs might be involved. RESULTS: Of the 754 
      microRNAs on the polymerase chain reaction array, 346 were detected in ≥75% of 
      participants' cervical swabs. Average cervical microRNA expression was 
      significantly higher in cases of spontaneous preterm birth than in controls 
      (P=.01). There were 95 significantly up-regulated individual microRNAs (>2-fold 
      change) in cases of subsequent spontaneous preterm birth compared with term 
      controls (P<.05; q<0.2). Notably, miR-143, miR-30e-3p, and miR-199b were all 
      significantly up-regulated, which is consistent with the 1 previous study of 
      cervical microRNA and spontaneous preterm birth. A Relief-based, novel variable 
      (feature) selection machine learning approach had low-to-moderate prediction 
      accuracy, with an area under the receiver operating curve of 0.71. Enrichment 
      analysis revealed that identified microRNAs may modulate inflammatory cell 
      signaling. CONCLUSION: In this prospective nested case-control study of cervical 
      microRNA expression and spontaneous preterm birth, we identified a global 
      increase in microRNA expression and up-regulation of 95 distinct microRNAs in 
      association with subsequent spontaneous preterm birth. Larger and more diverse 
      studies are required to determine the ability of microRNAs to accurately predict 
      spontaneous preterm birth, and mechanistic work to facilitate development of 
      novel therapeutic interventions to prevent spontaneous preterm birth is 
      warranted.

AB  - Previous work on murine models and humans demonstrated global as well as 
      tissue-specific molecular ageing trajectories of RNAs. Extracellular vesicles 
      (EVs) are membrane vesicles mediating the horizontal transfer of genetic 
      information between different tissues. We sequenced small regulatory RNAs 
      (sncRNAs) in two mouse plasma fractions at five time points across the lifespan 
      from 2-18 months: (1) sncRNAs that are free-circulating (fc-RNA) and (2) sncRNAs 
      bound outside or inside EVs (EV-RNA). Different sncRNA classes exhibit unique 
      ageing patterns that vary between the fcRNA and EV-RNA fractions. While tRNAs 
      showed the highest correlation with ageing in both fractions, rRNAs exhibited 
      inverse correlation trajectories between the EV- and fc-fractions. For miRNAs, 
      the EV-RNA fraction was exceptionally strongly associated with ageing, especially 
      the miR-29 family in adipose tissues. Sequencing of sncRNAs and coding genes in 
      fat tissue of an independent cohort of aged mice up to 27 months highlighted the 
      pivotal role of miR-29a-3p and miR-29b-3p in ageing-related gene regulation that 
      we validated in a third cohort by RT-qPCR.

PG  - e14146
LID - 10.7717/peerj.14146 [doi]
LID - e14146
AB  - MicroRNAs are key components of cellular regulatory networks, and breakdown in 
      miRNA function causes cascading effects leading to pathophenotypes. A better 
      understanding of the role of miRNAs in diseases is essential for human health. 
      Here, we have devised a method for comprehensively mapping the associations 
      between miRNAs and diseases by merging on a common key between two curated omics 
      databases. The resulting bidirectional resource, miR2Trait, is more detailed than 
      earlier catalogs, uncovers new relationships, and includes analytical utilities 
      to interrogate and extract knowledge from these datasets. miR2Trait provides 
      resources to compute the disease enrichment of a user-given set of miRNAs and 
      analyze the miRNA profile of a specified diseasome. Reproducible examples 
      demonstrating use-cases for each of these resource components are illustrated. 
      Furthermore we used these tools to construct pairwise miRNA-miRNA and 
      disease-disease enrichment networks, and identified 23 central miRNAs that could 
      underlie major regulatory functions in the human genome. miR2Trait is available 
      as an open-source command-line interface in Python3 (URL: 
      https://github.com/miR2Trait) with a companion wiki documenting the scripts and 
      data resources developed, under MIT license for commercial and non-commercial 
      use. A minimal web-based implementation has been made available at 
      https://sas.sastra.edu/pymir18. Supplementary information is available at:

TI  - TAM 2.0: tool for MicroRNA set analysis.
PG  - W180-W185
LID - 10.1093/nar/gky509 [doi]
AB  - With the rapid accumulation of high-throughput microRNA (miRNA) expression 
      profile, the up-to-date resource for analyzing the functional and disease 
      associations of miRNAs is increasingly demanded. We here describe the updated 
      server TAM 2.0 for miRNA set enrichment analysis. Through manual curation of over 
      9000 papers, a more than two-fold growth of reference miRNA sets has been 
      achieved in comparison with previous TAM, which covers 9945 and 1584 newly 
      collected miRNA-disease and miRNA-function associations, respectively. Moreover, 
      TAM 2.0 allows users not only to test the functional and disease annotations of

AB  - The use of easily accessible peripheral samples, such as blood or saliva, to 
      investigate neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders is well-established in 
      genetic and epigenetic research, but the pathological implications of such 
      biomarkers are not easily discerned. To better understand the relationship 
      between peripheral blood- and brain-based epigenetic activity, we conducted a 
      pilot study on captive baboons (Papio hamadryas) to investigate correlations 
      between miRNA expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and 14 
      different cortical and subcortical brain regions, represented by two study groups 
      comprised of 4 and 6 animals. Using next-generation sequencing, we identified 362 
      miRNAs expressed at ≥ 10 read counts in 80% or more of the brain samples 
      analyzed. Nominally significant pairwise correlations (one-sided P < 0.05) 
      between peripheral blood and mean brain expression levels of individual miRNAs 
      were observed for 39 and 44 miRNAs in each group. When miRNA expression levels 
      were averaged for tissue type across animals within the groups, Spearman's rank 
      correlations between PBMCs and the brain regions are all highly significant (r 
      (s) = 0.47-0.57; P < 2.2 × 10(-16)), although pairwise correlations among the 
      brain regions are markedly stronger (r (s) = 0.86-0.99). Principal component 
      analysis revealed differentiation in miRNA expression between peripheral blood 
      and the brain regions for the first component (accounting for ∼75% of variance). 
      Linear mixed effects modeling attributed most of the variance in expression to 
      differences between miRNAs (>70%), with non-significant 7.5% and 13.1% assigned 
      to differences between blood and brain-based samples in the two study groups. 
      Hierarchical UPGMA clustering revealed a major co-expression branch in both study 
      groups, comprised of miRNAs globally upregulated in blood relative to the brain 
      samples, exhibiting an enrichment of miRNAs expressed in immune cells (CD14+, 
      CD15+, CD19+, CD3+, and CD56 + leukocytes) among the top blood-brain correlates, 
      with the gene MYC, encoding a master transcription factor that regulates 
      angiogenesis and neural stem cell activation, representing the most prevalent 
      miRNA target. Although some differentiation was observed between tissue types, 
      these preliminary findings reveal wider correlated patterns between blood- and 
      brain-expressed miRNAs, suggesting the potential utility of blood-based miRNA 
      profiling for investigating by proxy certain miRNA activity in the brain, with 
      implications for neuroinflammatory and c-Myc-mediated processes.

AB  - The study of cancer prognosis serves as an important part of cancer research. 
      Large-scale cancer studies have identified numerous genes and microRNAs (miRNAs) 
      associated with prognosis. These informative genes and miRNAs represent potential 
      biomarkers to predict survival and to elucidate the molecular mechanism of tumour 
      progression. MiRNAs and transcription factors (TFs) can work cooperatively as 
      essential mediators of gene expression, and their dysregulation affects cancer 
      prognosis. A panoramic view of cancer prognosis at the system level, considering 
      the co-regulation roles of miRNA and TF, remains elusive. Here, we establish 12 
      prognosis-related miRNA-TF co-regulatory networks. The characteristics of 
      prognostic target genes and their regulators in the network are depicted. 
      Although the target genes and co-regulatory patterns exhibit cancer-specific 
      properties, some miRNAs and TFs are highly conserved across cancers. We 
      illustrate and interpret the roles of these conserved regulators by building a 
      model associated with cancer hallmarks, functional enrichment analysis, network 
      community detection, and exhaustive literature research. The elaborated 
      system-level prognostic miRNA-TF co-regulation landscape, including the 
      highlighted roles of conserved regulators, provides a novel and powerful insights 
      into further biological and medical discoveries.

AB  - Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's 
      disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and 
      dementia pose one of the greatest health challenges this century. Although these 
      NDs have been looked at as single entities, the underlying molecular mechanisms 
      have never been collectively visualized to date. With the advent of 
      high-throughput genomic and proteomic technologies, we now have the opportunity 
      to visualize these diseases in a whole new perspective, which will provide a 
      clear understanding of the primary and secondary events vital in achieving the 
      final resolution of these diseases guiding us to new treatment strategies to 
      possibly treat these diseases together. We created a knowledge base of all 
      microRNAs known to be differentially expressed in various body fluids of ND 
      patients. We then used several bioinformatic methods to understand the functional 
      intersections and differences between AD, PD, ALS, and MS. These results provide 
      a unique panoramic view of possible functional intersections between AD, PD, MS, 
      and ALS at the level of microRNA and their cognate genes and pathways, along with 
      the entities that unify and separate them. While the microRNA signatures were 
      apparent for each ND, the unique observation in our study was that hsa-miR-30b-5p 
      overlapped between all four NDS, and has significant functional roles described 
      across NDs. Furthermore, our results also show the evidence of functional 
      convergence of miRNAs which was associated with the regulation of their cognate 
      genes represented in pathways that included fatty acid synthesis and metabolism, 
      ECM receptor interactions, prion diseases, and several signaling pathways 
      critical to neuron differentiation and survival, underpinning their relevance in 
      NDs. Envisioning this group of NDs together has allowed us to propose new ways of 
      utilizing circulating miRNAs as biomarkers  and in visualizing diverse NDs more 
      holistically . The critical molecular insights gained through the discovery of 
      ND-associated miRNAs, overlapping miRNAs, and the functional convergence of 
      microRNAs on vital pathways strongly implicated in neurodegenerative processes 
      can prove immensely valuable in the identifying new generation of biomarkers, 
      along with the development of miRNAs into therapeutics.

AB  - American Tegumentary Leishmaniasis (ATL) is an endemic disease in Latin America, 
      mainly caused in Brazil by Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis. Clinical 
      manifestations vary from mild, localized cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) to 
      aggressive mucosal disease. The host immune response strongly determines the 
      outcome of infection and pattern of disease. However, the pathogenesis of ATL is 
      not well understood, and host microRNAs (miRNAs) may have a role in this context. 
      In the present study, miRNAs were quantified using qPCR arrays in human monocytic 
      THP-1 cells infected in vitro with L. (V.) braziliensis promastigotes and in 
      plasma from patients with ATL, focusing on inflammatory response-specific miRNAs. 
      Patients with active or self-healed cutaneous leishmaniasis patients, with 
      confirmed parasitological or immunological diagnosis, were compared with healthy 
      controls. Computational target prediction of significantly-altered miRNAs from in 
      vitro L. (V.) braziliensis-infected THP-1 cells revealed predicted targets 
      involved in diverse pathways, including chemokine signaling, inflammatory, 
      cellular proliferation, and tissue repair processes. In plasma, we observed 
      distinct miRNA expression in patients with self-healed and active lesions 
      compared with healthy controls. Some miRNAs dysregulated during THP-1 in vitro 
      infection were also found in plasma from self-healed patients, including 
      miR-548d-3p, which was upregulated in infected THP-1 cells and in plasma from 
      self-healed patients. As miR-548d-3p was predicted to target the chemokine 
      pathway and inflammation is a central to the pathogenesis of ATL, we evaluated 
      the effect of transient transfection of a miR-548d-3p inhibitor on L. (V.) 
      braziliensis infected-THP-1 cells. Inhibition of miR-548d-3p reduced parasite 
      growth early after infection and increased production of MCP1/CCL2, RANTES/CCL5, 
      and IP10/CXCL10. In plasma of self-healed patients, MCP1/CCL2, RANTES/CCL5, and 
      IL-8/CXCL8 concentrations were significantly decreased and MIG/CXCL9 and 
      IP-10/CXCL10 increased compared to patients with active disease. These data 
      suggest that by modulating miRNAs, L. (V.) braziliensis may interfere with 
      chemokine production and hence the inflammatory processes underpinning lesion 
      resolution. Our data suggest miR-548d-3p could be further evaluated as a 
      prognostic marker for ATL and/or as a host-directed therapeutic target.

AB  - Analyzing all features of small non-coding RNA sequencing data can be demanding 
      and challenging. To facilitate this process, we developed miRMaster. After the 
      analysis of over 125 000 human samples and 1.5 trillion human small RNA reads 
      over 4 years, we present miRMaster 2 with a wide range of updates and new 
      features. We extended our reference data sets so that miRMaster 2 now supports 
      the analysis of eight species (e.g. human, mouse, chicken, dog, cow) and 10 
      non-coding RNA classes (e.g. microRNAs, piRNAs, tRNAs, rRNAs, circRNAs). We also 
      incorporated new downstream analysis modules such as batch effect analysis or 
      sample embeddings using UMAP, and updated annotation data bases included by 
      default (miRBase, Ensembl, GtRNAdb). To accommodate the increasing popularity of 
      single cell small-RNA sequencing data, we incorporated a module for unique 
      molecular identifier (UMI) processing. Further, the output tables and graphics 
      have been improved based on user feedback and new output formats that emerged in 
      the community are now supported (e.g. miRGFF3). Finally, we integrated 
      differential expression analysis with the miRNA enrichment analysis tool miEAA.

PG  - 1483-1493
LID - 10.1101/gad.303537.117 [doi]
AB  - While microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate the vast majority of protein-encoding 
      transcripts, little is known about how miRNAs themselves are degraded. We 
      recently described Tudor-staphylococcal/micrococcal-like nuclease (TSN)-mediated 
      miRNA decay (TumiD) as a cellular pathway in which the nuclease TSN promotes the 
      decay of miRNAs that contain CA and/or UA dinucleotides. While TSN-mediated 
      degradation of either protein-free or AGO2-loaded miRNAs does not require the 
      ATP-dependent RNA helicase UPF1 in vitro, we report here that cellular TumiD 
      requires UPF1. Results from experiments using AGO2-loaded miRNAs in duplex with 
      target mRNAs indicate that UPF1 can dissociate miRNAs from their mRNA targets, 
      making the miRNAs susceptible to TumiD. miR-seq (deep sequencing of miRNAs) data 
      reveal that the degradation of ∼50% of candidate TumiD targets in T24 human 
      urinary bladder cancer cells is augmented by UPF1. We illustrate the 
      physiological relevance by demonstrating that UPF1-augmented TumiD promotes the 
      invasion of T24 cells in part by degrading anti-invasive miRNAs so as to 
      up-regulate the expression of proinvasive proteins.

PG  - 1791-1798

AB  - An increasing number of studies propose circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) as 
      biomarkers for a large number of human diseases including cancer, cardiovascular 
      diseases, neurologic pathologies and others. To further validate miRNA as 
      biomarkers it is indispensable to understand the variability of circulating 
      miRNAs in healthy individuals. We determined the longitudinal miRNomes of 90 
      serum samples from the Janus Serum Bank in Norway, which have been stored between 
      23 and 40 y at -25 °Celsius. We profiled 3 serum samples with microarrays for 30 
      individuals, each. For each individual the samples were collected with a time 
      interval of approximately 5 y. This design allowed insights into inter-individual 
      variability, age dependent miRNA variability and the impact of storage length and 
      pre-processing. A significant proportion of the miRNome was affected by the age 
      of the blood donor and a not negligible, albeit small, part of the miRNome by the 
      storage time. A substantial part of miRNAs was differentially abundant between 
      individuals, independent of the time when samples were collected. Stepwise 
      filtering of the 529 miRNAs that were detected in the serum samples showed 168 
      miRNAs with differential abundance depending on the time point analyzed, 56 
      miRNAs differentially abundant between individuals, and 169 miRNAs with an 
      abundance depending on the sampling procedure. While these groups of miRNAs 
      contain generally interesting and biologically important miRNAs, the remaining 
      135 miRNAs constitute very promising biomarker candidates as they show an overall 
      low variability between healthy individuals, a likewise overall low variability 
      across a longer life span, and a high independence of the sampling process and 
      the storage length.

LID - 1187375
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, can 
      infect almost any nucleated cell in the mammalian host. Although previous studies 
      have described the transcriptomic changes that occur in host cells during 
      parasite infection, the understanding of the role of post-transcriptional 
      regulation in this process is limited. MicroRNAs, a class of short non-coding 
      RNAs, are key players in regulating gene expression at the post-transcriptional 
      level, and their involvement in the host-T. cruzi interplay is a growing area of 
      research. However, to our knowledge, there are no comparative studies on the 
      microRNA changes that occur in different cell types in response to T. cruzi 
      infection. METHODS AND RESULTS: Here we investigated microRNA changes in 
      epithelial cells, cardiomyocytes and macrophages infected with T. cruzi for 24 
      hours, using small RNA sequencing followed by careful bioinformatics analysis. We 
      show that, although microRNAs are highly cell type-specific, a signature of three 
      microRNAs -miR-146a, miR-708 and miR-1246, emerges as consistently responsive to 
      T. cruzi infection across representative human cell types. T. cruzi lacks 
      canonical microRNA-induced silencing mechanisms and we confirm that it does not 
      produce any small RNA that mimics known host microRNAs. We found that macrophages 
      show a broad response to parasite infection, while microRNA changes in epithelial 
      and cardiomyocytes are modest. Complementary data indicated that cardiomyocyte 
      response may be greater at early time points of infection. CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      findings emphasize the significance of considering microRNA changes at the 
      cellular level and complement previous studies conducted at higher organizational 
      levels, such as heart samples. While miR-146a has been previously implicated in 
      T. cruzi infection, similarly to its involvement in many other immunological 
      responses, miR-1246 and miR-708 are demonstrated here for the first time. Given 
      their expression in multiple cell types, we anticipate our work as a starting 
      point for future investigations into their role in the post-transcriptional 
      regulation of T. cruzi infected cells and their potential as biomarkers for 
      Chagas disease.

TI  - miEAA 2023: updates, new functional microRNA sets and improved enrichment 
      visualizations.

AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that play a critical role in 
      regulating diverse biological processes. Extracting functional insights from a 
      list of miRNAs is challenging, as each miRNA can potentially interact with 
      hundreds of genes. To address this challenge, we developed miEAA, a flexible and 
      comprehensive miRNA enrichment analysis tool based on direct and indirect miRNA 
      annotation. The latest release of miEAA includes a data warehouse of 19 miRNA 
      repositories, covering 10 different organisms and 139 399 functional categories. 
      We have added information on the cellular context of miRNAs, isomiRs, and 
      high-confidence miRNAs to improve the accuracy of the results. We have also 
      improved the representation of aggregated results, including interactive Upset 
      plots to aid users in understanding the interaction among enriched terms or 
      categories. Finally, we demonstrate the functionality of miEAA in the context of 
      ageing and highlight the importance of carefully considering the miRNA input 
      list. MiEAA is free to use and publicly available at 
      https://www.ccb.uni-saarland.de/mieaa/.

PG  - 1053-1060
LID - 10.1007/s12551-018-0435-2 [doi]
AB  - Genome-wide association studies have shed light on the association between 
      natural genetic variation and cardiovascular traits. However, linking a 
      cardiovascular trait associated locus to a candidate gene or set of candidate 
      genes for prioritization for follow-up mechanistic studies is all but 
      straightforward. Genomic technologies based on next-generation sequencing 
      technology nowadays offer multiple opportunities to dissect gene regulatory 
      networks underlying genetic cardiovascular trait associations, thereby aiding in 
      the identification of candidate genes at unprecedented scale. RNA sequencing in 
      particular becomes a powerful tool when combined with genotyping to identify loci 
      that modulate transcript abundance, known as expression quantitative trait loci 
      (eQTL), or loci modulating transcript splicing known as splicing quantitative 
      trait loci (sQTL). Additionally, the allele-specific resolution of RNA-sequencing 
      technology enables estimation of allelic imbalance, a state where the two alleles 
      of a gene are expressed at a ratio differing from the expected 1:1 ratio. When 
      multiple high-throughput approaches are combined with deep phenotyping in a 
      single study, a comprehensive elucidation of the relationship between genotype 
      and phenotype comes into view, an approach known as systems genetics. In this 
      review, we cover key applications of systems genetics in the broad cardiovascular 
      field.

TI  - Inferring the Disease-Associated miRNAs Based on Network Representation Learning 
      and Convolutional Neural Networks.
LID - 10.3390/ijms20153648 [doi]
LID - 3648
AB  - Identification of disease-associated miRNAs (disease miRNAs) are critical for 
      understanding etiology and pathogenesis. Most previous methods focus on 
      integrating similarities and associating information contained in heterogeneous 
      miRNA-disease networks. However, these methods establish only shallow prediction 
      models that fail to capture complex relationships among miRNA similarities, 
      disease similarities, and miRNA-disease associations. We propose a prediction 
      method on the basis of network representation learning and convolutional neural 
      networks to predict disease miRNAs, called CNNMDA. CNNMDA deeply integrates the 
      similarity information of miRNAs and diseases, miRNA-disease associations, and 
      representations of miRNAs and diseases in low-dimensional feature space. The new 
      framework based on deep learning was built to learn the original and global 
      representation of a miRNA-disease pair. First, diverse biological premises about 
      miRNAs and diseases were combined to construct the embedding layer in the left 
      part of the framework, from a biological perspective. Second, the various 
      connection edges in the miRNA-disease network, such as similarity and association 
      connections, were dependent on each other. Therefore, it was necessary to learn 
      the low-dimensional representations of the miRNA and disease nodes based on the 
      entire network. The right part of the framework learnt the low-dimensional 
      representation of each miRNA and disease node based on non-negative matrix 
      factorization, and these representations were used to establish the corresponding 
      embedding layer. Finally, the left and right embedding layers went through 
      convolutional modules to deeply learn the complex and non-linear relationships 
      among the similarities and associations between miRNAs and diseases. Experimental 
      results based on cross validation indicated that CNNMDA yields superior 
      performance compared to several state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, case 
      studies on lung, breast, and pancreatic neoplasms demonstrated the powerful 
      ability of CNNMDA to discover potential disease miRNAs.

TI  - Circulating exosomal microRNA expression patterns distinguish cardiac sarcoidosis 
      from myocardial ischemia.
PG  - e0246083
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0246083 [doi]
LID - e0246083
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Cardiac sarcoidosis is difficult to diagnose, often requiring 
      expensive and inconvenient advanced imaging techniques. Circulating exosomes 
      contain genetic material, such as microRNA (miRNA), that are derived from 
      diseased tissues and may serve as potential disease-specific biomarkers. We thus 
      sought to determine whether circulating exosome-derived miRNA expression patterns 
      would distinguish cardiac sarcoidosis (CS) from acute myocardial infarction 
      (AMI). METHODS: Plasma and serum samples conforming to CS, AMI or disease-free 
      controls were procured from the Biologic Specimen and Data Repository Information 
      Coordinating Center repository and National Jewish Health. Next generation 
      sequencing (NGS) was performed on exosome-derived total RNA (n = 10 for each 
      group), and miRNA expression levels were compared after normalization using 
      housekeeping miRNA. Quality assurance measures excluded poor quality RNA samples. 
      Differentially expressed (DE) miRNA patterns, based upon >2-fold change (p < 
      0.01), were established in CS compared to controls, and in CS compared to AMI. 
      Relative expression of several DE-miRNA were validated by qRT-PCR. RESULTS: 
      Despite the advanced age of the stored samples (~5-30 years), the quality of the 
      exosome-derived miRNA was intact in ~88% of samples. Comparing plasma exosomal 
      miRNA in CS versus controls, NGS yielded 18 DE transcripts (12 up-regulated, 6 
      down-regulated), including miRNA previously implicated in mechanisms of 
      myocardial injury (miR-92, miR-21) and immune responses (miR-618, miR-27a). NGS 
      further yielded 52 DE miRNA in serum exosomes from CS versus AMI: 5 up-regulated 
      in CS; 47 up-regulated in AMI, including transcripts previously detected in AMI 
      patients (miR-1-1, miR-133a, miR-208b, miR-423, miR-499). Five miRNAs with 
      increased DE in CS included two isoforms of miR-624 and miR-144, previously 
      reported as markers of cardiomyopathy. CONCLUSIONS: MiRNA patterns of exosomes 
      derived from CS and AMI patients are distinct, suggesting that circulating 
      exosomal miRNA patterns could serve as disease biomarkers. Further studies are 
      required to establish their specificity relative to other cardiac disorders.

LID - 10.18632/aging.103965 [doi]
AB  - Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a severe disease with the highest mortality rate among 
      various cancers. It is urgent to find an effective and accurate way to predict 
      the survival of PC patients. Gene set variation analysis (GSVA) was used to 
      establish and validate a miRNA set-based pathway prognostic signature for PC 
      (miPPSPC) and a mRNA set-based pathway prognostic signature for PC (mPPSPC) in 
      independent datasets. An optimized miPPSPC was constructed by combining clinical 
      parameters. The miPPSPC, optimized miPPSPC and mPPSPC were established and 
      validated to predict the survival of PC patients and showed excellent predictive 
      ability. Four metabolic pathways and one oxidative stress pathway were identified 
      in the miPPSPC, whereas linoleic acid metabolism and the pentose phosphate 
      pathway were identified in the mPPSPC. Key factors of the pentose phosphate 
      pathway and linoleic acid metabolism, G6PD and CYP2C8/9/18/19, respectively, are 
      related to the survival of PC patients according to our tissue microarray. Thus, 
      the miPPSPC, optimized miPPSPC and mPPSPC can predict the survival of PC patients 
      efficiently and precisely. The metabolic and oxidative stress pathways may 
      participate in PC progression.

TI  - miRPathDB 2.0: a novel release of the miRNA Pathway Dictionary Database.
PG  - D142-D147
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkz1022 [doi]
AB  - Since the initial release of miRPathDB, tremendous progress has been made in the 
      field of microRNA (miRNA) research. New miRNA reference databases have emerged, a 
      vast amount of new miRNA candidates has been discovered and the number of 
      experimentally validated target genes has increased considerably. Hence, the 
      demand for a major upgrade of miRPathDB, including extended analysis 
      functionality and intuitive visualizations of query results has emerged. Here, we 
      present the novel release 2.0 of the miRNA Pathway Dictionary Database 
      (miRPathDB) that is freely accessible at https://mpd.bioinf.uni-sb.de/. miRPathDB 
      2.0 comes with a ten-fold increase of pre-processed data. In total, the updated 
      database provides putative associations between 27 452 (candidate) miRNAs, 28 352 
      targets and 16 833 pathways for Homo sapiens, as well as interactions of 1978 
      miRNAs, 24 898 targets and 6511 functional categories for Mus musculus. 
      Additionally, we analyzed publications citing miRPathDB to identify common 
      use-cases and further extensions. Based on this evaluation, we added new 
      functionality for interactive visualizations and down-stream analyses of bulk 
      queries. In summary, the updated version of miRPathDB, with its new 
      custom-tailored features, is one of the most comprehensive and advanced resources 
      for miRNAs and their target pathways.

TI  - HumiR: Web Services, Tools and Databases for Exploring Human microRNA Data.
LID - 10.3390/biom10111576 [doi]
LID - 1576
AB  - For many research aspects on small non-coding RNAs, especially microRNAs, 
      computational tools and databases are developed. This includes quantification of 
      miRNAs, piRNAs, tRNAs and tRNA fragments, circRNAs and others. Furthermore, the 
      prediction of new miRNAs, isomiRs, arm switch events, target and target pathway 
      prediction and miRNA pathway enrichment are common tasks. Additionally, databases 
      and resources containing expression profiles, e.g., from different tissues, 
      organs or cell types, are generated. This information in turn leads to improved 
      miRNA repositories. While most of the respective tools are implemented in a 
      species-independent manner, we focused on tools for human small non-coding RNAs. 
      This includes four aspects: (1) miRNA analysis tools (2) databases on miRNAs and 
      variations thereof (3) databases on expression profiles (4) miRNA helper tools 
      facilitating frequent tasks such as naming conversion or reporter assay design. 
      Although dependencies between the tools exist and several tools are jointly used 
      in studies, the interoperability is limited. We present HumiR, a joint web 
      presence for our tools. HumiR facilitates an entry in the world of miRNA 
      research, supports the selection of the right tool for a research task and 
      represents the very first step towards a fully integrated knowledge-base for 
      human small non-coding RNA research. We demonstrate the utility of HumiR by 
      performing a very comprehensive analysis of Alzheimer's miRNAs.

TI  - Identifying miRNA synergism using multiple-intervention causal inference.
PG  - 613
LID - 10.1186/s12859-019-3215-5 [doi]
LID - 613
AB  - BACKGROUND: Studying multiple microRNAs (miRNAs) synergism in gene regulation 
      could help to understand the regulatory mechanisms of complicated human diseases 
      caused by miRNAs. Several existing methods have been presented to infer miRNA 
      synergism. Most of the current methods assume that miRNAs with shared targets at 
      the sequence level are working synergistically. However, it is unclear if miRNAs 
      with shared targets are working in concert to regulate the targets or they 
      individually regulate the targets at different time points or different 
      biological processes. A standard method to test the synergistic activities is to 
      knock-down multiple miRNAs at the same time and measure the changes in the target 
      genes. However, this approach may not be practical as we would have too many sets 
      of miRNAs to test. RESULTS: n this paper, we present a novel framework called 
      miRsyn for inferring miRNA synergism by using a causal inference method that 
      mimics the multiple-intervention experiments, e.g. knocking-down multiple miRNAs, 
      with observational data. Our results show that several miRNA-miRNA pairs that 
      have shared targets at the sequence level are not working synergistically at the 
      expression level. Moreover, the identified miRNA synergistic network is 
      small-world and biologically meaningful, and a number of miRNA synergistic 
      modules are significantly enriched in breast cancer. Our further analyses also 
      reveal that most of synergistic miRNA-miRNA pairs show the same expression 
      patterns. The comparison results indicate that the proposed multiple-intervention 
      causal inference method performs better than the single-intervention causal 
      inference method in identifying miRNA synergistic network. CONCLUSIONS: Taken 
      together, the results imply that miRsyn is a promising framework for identifying 
      miRNA synergism, and it could enhance the understanding of miRNA synergism in 
      breast cancer.

TI  - MicroRNA Profile for Diagnostic and Prognostic Biomarkers in Thyroid Cancer.
LID - 10.3390/cancers13040632 [doi]
LID - 632
AB  - The challenge in managing thyroid nodules is to accurately diagnose the minority 
      of those with malignancy. We aimed to identify diagnostic and prognostic miRNA 
      markers for thyroid nodules. In a discovery cohort, we identified 20 candidate 
      miRNAs to differentiate between noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasms with 
      papillary-like nuclear features (NIFTP) and papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC) by 
      using the high-throughput small RNA sequencing method. We then selected three 
      miRNAs (miR-136, miR-21, and miR-127) that were differentially expressed between 
      the PTC follicular variant and other variants in The Cancer Genome Atlas data. 
      High expression of three miRNAs differentiated thyroid cancer from nonmalignant 
      tumors, with an area under curve (AUC) of 0.76-0.81 in an independent cohort. In 
      patients with differentiated thyroid cancer, the high-level expression of the 
      three miRNAs was an independent indicator for both distant metastases and 
      recurrent or persistent disease. In patients with PTC, a high expression of 
      miRNAs was associated with an aggressive histologic variant, extrathyroidal 
      extension, distant metastasis, or recurrent or persistent disease. Three miRNAs 
      may be used as diagnostic markers for differentiating thyroid cancers from benign 
      tumors and tumors with extremely low malignant potential (NIFTP), as well as 
      prognostic markers for predicting the risk of recurrent/persistent disease for 
      differentiated thyroid cancer.

AB  - Aging is a key risk factor for chronic diseases of the elderly. MicroRNAs 
      regulate post-transcriptional gene silencing through base-pair binding on their 
      target mRNAs. We identified nonlinear changes in age-related microRNAs by 
      analyzing whole blood from 1334 healthy individuals. We observed a larger 
      influence of the age as compared to the sex and provide evidence for a shift to 
      the 5' mature form of miRNAs in healthy aging. The addition of 3059 diseased 
      patients uncovered pan-disease and disease-specific alterations in aging 
      profiles. Disease biomarker sets for all diseases were different between young 
      and old patients. Computational deconvolution of whole-blood miRNAs into blood 
      cell types suggests that cell intrinsic gene expression changes may impart 
      greater significance than cell abundance changes to the whole blood miRNA 
      profile. Altogether, these data provide a foundation for understanding the 
      relationship between healthy aging and disease, and for the development of 
      age-specific disease biomarkers.

TI  - MicroRNA Alterations in a Tg501 Mouse Model of Prion Disease.
LID - 10.3390/biom10060908 [doi]
LID - 908
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) may contribute to the development and pathology of many 
      neurodegenerative diseases, including prion diseases. They are also promising 
      biomarker candidates due to their stability in body fluids. We investigated miRNA 
      alterations in a Tg501 mouse model of prion diseases that expresses a transgene 
      encoding the goat prion protein (PRNP). Tg501 mice intracranially inoculated with 
      mouse-adapted goat scrapie were compared with age-matched, mock inoculated 
      controls in preclinical and clinical stages. Small RNA sequencing from the 
      cervical spinal cord indicated that miR-223-3p, miR-151-3p, and miR-144-5p were 
      dysregulated in scrapie-inoculated animals before the onset of symptoms. In 
      clinical-stage animals, 23 significant miRNA alterations were found. These miRNAs 
      were predicted to modify the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) 
      pathways including prion disease, extracellular matrix interactions, 
      glutaminergic synapse, axon guidance, and transforming growth factor-beta 
      signaling. MicroRNAs miR-146a-5p (up in cervical spinal cord) and miR-342-3p 
      (down in cervical spinal cord, cerebellum and plasma), both indicated in 
      neurodegenerative diseases earlier, were verified by quantitative real-time 
      polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Minimal changes observed before the disease 
      onset suggests that most miRNA alterations observed here are driven by advanced 
      prion-associated pathology, possibly limiting their use as diagnostic markers. 
      However, the results encourage further mechanistic studies on miRNA-regulated 
      pathways involved in these neurodegenerative conditions.

AB  - Blood-borne small non-coding (sncRNAs) are among the prominent candidates for 
      blood-based diagnostic tests. Often, high-throughput approaches are applied to 
      discover biomarker signatures. These have to be validated in larger cohorts and 
      evaluated by adequate statistical learning approaches. Previously, we published 
      high-throughput sequencing based microRNA (miRNA) signatures in Alzheimer's 
      disease (AD) patients in the United States (US) and Germany. Here, we determined 
      abundance levels of 21 known circulating miRNAs in 465 individuals encompassing 
      AD patients and controls by RT-qPCR. We computed models to assess the relation 
      between miRNA expression and phenotypes, gender, age, or disease severity 
      (Mini-Mental State Examination; MMSE). Of the 21 miRNAs, expression levels of 20 
      miRNAs were consistently de-regulated in the US and German cohorts. 18 miRNAs 
      were significantly correlated with neurodegeneration (Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted 
      P < 0.05) with highest significance for miR-532-5p (Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted 
      P = 4.8 × 10(-30)). Machine learning models reached an area under the curve (AUC) 
      value of 87.6% in differentiating AD patients from controls. Further, ten miRNAs 
      were significantly correlated with MMSE, in particular miR-26a/26b-5p (adjusted 
      P = 0.0002). Interestingly, the miRNAs with lower abundance in AD were enriched 
      in monocytes and T-helper cells, while those up-regulated in AD were enriched in 
      serum, exosomes, cytotoxic t-cells, and B-cells. Our study represents the next 
      important step in translational research for a miRNA-based AD test.

AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in a wide variety of cellular processes and 
      post-transcriptionally regulate several mechanism and diseases. However, 
      contribution of miRNAs functioning during hypoxia and DNA methylation together is 
      less understood. The current study was aimed to find a shared miRNAs signature 
      upstream to hypoxia (via HIF gene family members) and methylation (via DNMT gene 
      family members). This was followed by the global validation of the hypoxia 
      related miRNA signature using miRNA microarray meta-analysis of the hypoxia 
      induced human samples. We further concluded the study by looking into thrombosis 
      related terms and pathways enriched during protein-protein interaction (PPI) 
      network analysis of these two sets of gene family. Network prioritization of 
      these shared miRNAs reveals miR-129, miR-19band miR-23b as top regulatory miRNAs. 
      A comprehensive meta-analysis of microarray datasets of hypoxia samples 
      revealed 29 differentially expressed miRNAs. GSEA of the interacting genes in the 
      DNMT-HIF PPI network indicated thrombosis associated pathways including 
      "Hemostasis", "TPO signaling pathway" and "angiogenesis". Interestingly, the 
      study has generated a novel database of candidate miRNA signatures shared between 
      hypoxia and methylation, and their relation to thrombotic pathways, which might 
      aid in the development of potential therapeutic biomarkers.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Clinical associations between coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and 
      ischemic stroke (IS) have been reported. This study aimed to investigate the 
      shared genes between COVID-19 and IS and explore their regulatory mechanisms. 
      METHODS: Published datasets for COVID-19 and IS were downloaded. Common 
      differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the two diseases were identified, 
      followed by protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis. Moreover, 
      overlapping module genes associated with the two diseases were investigated using 
      weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA). Through intersection analysis of 
      PPI cluster genes and overlapping module genes, hub-shared genes associated with 
      the two diseases were obtained, followed by functional enrichment analysis and 
      external dataset validation. Moreover, the upstream miRNAs and transcription 
      factors (TFs) of the hub-shared genes were predicted. RESULTS: A total of 91 
      common DEGs were identified from the clusters of the PPI network, and 129 
      overlapping module genes were screened using WGCNA. Based on further intersection 
      analysis, four hub-shared genes in IS and COVID-19 were identified, including 
      PDE5A, ITGB3, CEACAM8, and BPI. These hub-shared genes were remarkably enriched 
      in pathways such as ECM-receptor interaction and focal adhesion pathways. 
      Moreover, ITGB3, PDE5A, and CEACAM8 were targeted by 53, 32, and 3 miRNAs, 
      respectively, and these miRNAs were also enriched in the aforementioned pathways. 
      Furthermore, TFs, such as lactoferrin, demonstrated a stronger predicted 
      correlation with the hub-shared genes. CONCLUSION: The four identified hub-shared 
      genes may participate in crucial mechanisms underlying both COVID-19 and IS and 
      may exhibit the potential to be biomarkers or therapeutic targets for the two 
      diseases.

AB  - The success of malignant tumors is conditioned by the intercellular communication 
      between tumor cells and their microenvironment, with extracellular vesicles (EVs) 
      acting as main mediators. While the value of 3D conditions to study tumor cells 
      is well established, the impact of cellular architecture on EV content and 
      function is not investigated yet. Here, a recently developed 3D cell culture 
      microwell array is adapted for EV production and a comprehensive comparative 
      analysis of biochemical features, RNA and proteomic profiles of EVs secreted by 
      2D vs 3D cultures of gastric cancer cells, is performed. 3D cultures are 
      significantly more efficient in producing EVs than 2D cultures. Global 
      upregulation of microRNAs and downregulation of proteins in 3D are observed, 
      indicating their dynamic coregulation in response to cellular architecture, with 
      the ADP-ribosylation factor 6 signaling pathway significantly downregulated in 3D 
      EVs. The data strengthen the biological relevance of cellular architecture for 
      production and cargo of EVs.

TI  - LncSEA: a platform for long non-coding RNA related sets and enrichment analysis.
PG  - D969-D980
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkaa806 [doi]
AB  - Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been proven to play important roles in 
      transcriptional processes and various biological functions. Establishing a 
      comprehensive collection of human lncRNA sets is urgent work at present. Using 
      reference lncRNA sets, enrichment analyses will be useful for analyzing lncRNA 
      lists of interest submitted by users. Therefore, we developed a human lncRNA sets 
      database, called LncSEA, which aimed to document a large number of available 
      resources for human lncRNA sets and provide annotation and enrichment analyses 
      for lncRNAs. LncSEA supports >40 000 lncRNA reference sets across 18 categories 
      and 66 sub-categories, and covers over 50 000 lncRNAs. We not only collected 
      lncRNA sets based on downstream regulatory data sources, but also identified a 
      large number of lncRNA sets regulated by upstream transcription factors (TFs) and 
      DNA regulatory elements by integrating TF ChIP-seq, DNase-seq, ATAC-seq and 
      H3K27ac ChIP-seq data. Importantly, LncSEA provides annotation and enrichment 
      analyses of lncRNA sets associated with upstream regulators and downstream 
      targets. In summary, LncSEA is a powerful platform that provides a variety of 
      types of lncRNA sets for users, and supports lncRNA annotations and enrichment 
      analyses. The LncSEA database is freely accessible at 
      http://bio.liclab.net/LncSEA/index.php.

TI  - Spring is in the air: seasonal profiles indicate vernal change of miRNA activity.

AB  - The envisioned application of miRNAs as diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers calls 
      for an in-depth understanding of their distribution and variability in different 
      physiological states. While effects with respect to ethnic origin, age, or gender 
      are known, the inter-individual variability of miRNAs across the four seasons 
      remained largely hidden. We sequentially profiled the complete repertoire of 
      blood-borne miRNAs for 25 physiologically normal individuals in spring, summer, 
      fall, and winter (altogether 95 samples) and validated the results on 292 
      individuals (919 samples collected with the Mitra home sampling device) by 
      RT-qPCR. Principal variance component analysis suggests that the largest 
      variability observed in miRNA expression is due to individual variability and the 
      individuals' gender. But the results also highlight a deviation of miRNA activity 
      in samples collected during spring time. Following adjustment for multiple 
      testing, remarkable differences are observed between spring and fall (77 miRNAs). 
      The two most dys-regulated miRNAs were miR-181c-5p and miR-106b-5p (adjusted 
      p-value of 0.007). Other significant miRNAs include miR-140-3p, miR-21-3p, and 
      let-7c-5p. The dys-regulation was validated by RT-qPCR. Systems biology analysis 
      further provides strong evidence for the immunological origin of the signals: 
      dys-regulated miRNAs are enriched in CD56 cells and belong to various signalling 
      and immune-system-related pathways. Our data suggest that besides known 
      confounding factors such as age and sex, also the season in which a test is 
      conducted might have a considerable influence on the expression of blood-borne 
      miRNAs and subsequently might interfere with diagnosis based on such signatures.

TI  - Epstein-Barr Virus Infection of Cell Lines Derived from Diffuse Large B-Cell 
      Lymphomas Alters MicroRNA Loading of the Ago2 Complex.
LID - 10.1128/JVI.01297-18 [doi]
LID - e01297-18
AB  - Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is an aggressive lymphoid tumor which is 
      occasionally Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) positive and is further subtyped as 
      activated B-cell DLBCL (ABC-DLBCL) and germinal center B-cell DLBCL (GCB-DLBCL), 
      which has implications for prognosis and treatment. We performed Ago2 RNA 
      immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput RNA sequencing (Ago2-RIP-seq) to 
      capture functionally active microRNAs (miRNAs) in EBV-negative ABC-DLBCL and 
      GCB-DLBCL cell lines and their EBV-infected counterparts. In parallel, total 
      miRNA profiles of these cells were determined to capture the cellular miRNA 
      profile for comparison with the functionally active profile. Selected miRNAs with 
      differential abundances were validated using real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) 
      and Northern blotting. We found 6 miRNAs with differential abundances (2 
      upregulated and 4 downregulated miRNAs) between EBV-negative and -positive 
      ABC-DLBCL cells and 12 miRNAs with differential abundances (3 upregulated and 9 
      downregulated miRNAs) between EBV-negative and -positive GCB-DLBCL cells. Eight 
      and twelve miRNAs were confirmed using RT-qPCR in ABC-DLBCL and GCB-DLBCL cells, 
      respectively. Selected miRNAs were analyzed in additional type I/II versus type 
      III EBV latency DLBCL cell lines. Furthermore, upregulation of miR-221-3p and 
      downregulation of let7c-5p in ABC-DLBCL cells and upregulation of miR-363-3p and 
      downregulation of miR-423-5p in GCB-DLBCL cells were verified using RIP-Northern 
      blotting. Our comprehensive sequence analysis of the DLBCL miRNA profiles 
      identified sets of deregulated miRNAs by Ago2-RIP-seq. Our Ago2-IP-seq miRNA 
      profile could be considered an important data set for the detection of 
      deregulated functionally active miRNAs in DLBCLs and could possibly lead to the 
      identification of miRNAs as biomarkers for the classification of DLBCLs or even 
      as targets for personalized targeted treatment.IMPORTANCE Diffuse large B-cell 
      lymphoma (DLBCL) is a highly aggressive tumor of lymphoid origin which is 
      occasionally Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) positive. MicroRNAs are found in most 
      multicellular organisms and even in viruses such as EBV. They regulate the 
      synthesis of proteins by binding to their cognate mRNA. MicroRNAs are tethered to 
      their target mRNAs by "Argonaute" proteins. Here we compared the overall miRNA 
      content of the Ago2 complex by differential loading to the overall content of 
      miRNAs in two DLBCL cell lines and their EBV-converted counterparts. In all cell 
      lines, the Ago2 load was different from the overall expression of miRNAs. In 
      addition, the loading of the Ago2 complex was changed upon infection with EBV. 
      This indicates that the virus not only changes the overall content of miRNAs but 
      also influences the expression of proteins by affecting the Ago complexes.

AB  - Influence of an intracranial aneurysm (IA) rupture on the expression of miRNAs 
      and the potential significance of the resulting changes remains poorly 
      understood. We aimed to characterize the response to the IA rupture through the 
      analysis of miRNAs in peripheral blood cells. Expression of small RNAs was 
      investigated using deep transcriptome sequencing in patients in the acute phase 
      of an IA rupture (first 72 h), in the chronic phase (3-15 months), and controls. 
      A functional analysis and the potential interactions between miRNAs and target 
      genes were investigated. We also measured the levels of proteins that were 
      influenced by regulated miRNAs. We found that 106 mature miRNAs and 90 miRNA 
      precursors were differentially expressed among the groups. The regulated miRNAs 
      were involved in a variety of pathways, and the top pathway involved 
      cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions. The identified miRNAs targeted the 
      inflammatory factors HMGB1 and FASLG. Changes in their expression were detected 
      at the mRNA and protein levels. IA rupture strongly influences the transcription 
      profiles in peripheral blood cells. The regulated miRNAs were involved in the 
      control of immune cell homeostasis. In summary, these results may aid in the 
      elucidation of the molecular mechanisms that orchestrate the inflammatory 
      response to IA rupture.

TI  - Omics Analysis of Educated Platelets in Cancer and Benign Disease of the 
      Pancreas.
LID - 10.3390/cancers13010066 [doi]
LID - 66
AB  - Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is traditionally associated with 
      thrombocytosis/hypercoagulation and novel insights on platelet-PDAC "dangerous 
      liaisons" are warranted. Here we performed an integrative omics study 
      investigating the biological processes of mRNAs and expressed miRNAs, as well as 
      proteins in PDAC blood platelets, using benign disease as a reference for 
      inflammatory noise. Gene ontology mining revealed enrichment of RNA splicing, 
      mRNA processing and translation initiation in miRNAs and proteins but depletion 
      in RNA transcripts. Remarkably, correlation analyses revealed a negative 
      regulation on SPARC transcription by isomiRs involved in cancer signaling, 
      suggesting a specific "education" in PDAC platelets. Platelets of benign patients 
      were enriched for non-templated additions of G nucleotides (#ntaG) miRNAs, while 
      PDAC presented length variation on 3' (lv3p) as the most frequent modification on 
      miRNAs. Additionally, we provided an actionable repertoire of PDAC and benign 
      platelet-ome to be exploited for future studies. In conclusion, our data show 
      that platelets change their biological repertoire in patients with PDAC, through 
      dysregulation of miRNAs and splicing factors, supporting the presence of de novo 
      protein machinery that can "educate" the platelet. These novel findings could be 
      further exploited for innovative liquid biopsies platforms as well as possible 
      therapeutic targets.

AB  - Saliva omics has immense potential for non-invasive diagnostics, including 
      monitoring very young or elderly populations, or individuals in remote locations. 
      In this study, multiple saliva omics from an individual were monitored over three 
      periods (100 timepoints) involving: (1) hourly sampling over 24 h without 
      intervention, (2) hourly sampling over 24 h including immune system activation 
      using the standard 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine, (3) daily 
      sampling for 33 days profiling the post-vaccination response. At each timepoint 
      total saliva transcriptome and proteome, and small RNA from salivary 
      extracellular vesicles were profiled, including mRNA, miRNA, piRNA and bacterial 
      RNA. The two 24-h periods were used in a paired analysis to remove daily 
      variation and reveal vaccination responses. Over 18,000 omics longitudinal series 
      had statistically significant temporal trends compared to a healthy baseline. 
      Various immune response and regulation pathways were activated following 
      vaccination, including interferon and cytokine signaling, and MHC antigen 
      presentation. Immune response timeframes were concordant with innate and adaptive 
      immunity development, and coincided with vaccination and reported fever. Overall, 
      mRNA results appeared more specific and sensitive (timewise) to vaccination 
      compared to other omics. The results suggest saliva omics can be consistently 
      assessed for non-invasive personalized monitoring and immune response 
      diagnostics.

AB  - Visceral leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum in Latin 
      America progress with hepatosplenomegaly, pancytopenia, hypergammaglobulinemia, 
      and weight loss and maybe lethal mainly in untreated cases. miRNAs are important 
      regulators of immune and inflammatory gene expression, but their mechanisms of 
      action and their relationship to pathogenesis in leishmaniasis are not well 
      understood. In the present study, we sought to quantify changes in miRNAs 
      associated with immune and inflammatory pathways using the L. (L.) infantum 
      promastigote infected- human monocytic THP-1 cell model and plasma from patients 
      with visceral leishmaniasis. We identified differentially expressed miRNAs in 
      infected THP-1 cells compared with non-infected cells using qPCR arrays. These 
      miRNAs were submitted to in silico analysis, revealing targets within functional 
      pathways associated with TGF-β, chemokines, glucose metabolism, inflammation, 
      apoptosis, and cell signaling. In parallel, we identified differentially 
      expressed miRNAs in active visceral leishmaniasis patient plasma compared with 
      endemic healthy controls. In silico analysis of these data indicated different 
      predicted targets within the TGF-β, TLR4, IGF-I, chemokine, and HIF1α pathways. 
      Only a small number of miRNAs were commonly identified in these two datasets, 
      notably with miR-548d-3p being up-regulated in both conditions. To evaluate the 
      potential biological role of miR-548d-3p, we transiently transfected a 
      miR-548d-3p inhibitor into L. (L.) infantum infected-THP-1 cells, finding that 
      inhibition of miR-548d-3p enhanced parasite growth, likely mediated through 
      reduced levels of MCP-1/CCL2 and nitric oxide production. Further work will be 
      required to determine how miR-548d-3p plays a role in vivo and whether it serves 
      as a potential biomarker of progressive leishmaniasis.

PG  - 893303
LID - 10.3389/fpsyt.2022.893303 [doi]
LID - 893303
AB  - BACKGROUND: Opioid use disorder (OUD), which is most commonly exhibited as 
      addiction, is a persistent chronic disease that places a burden on families and 
      society. Various peripheral traits have been linked to OUD in the past, but 
      research on this topic is insufficient. METHODS: Seven male patients with OUD and 
      7 male healthy controls with matched demographic and clinical data were enrolled 
      in this study. Peripheral blood RNA was used to construct an rRNA-removed library 
      and a small RNA library. The peripheral transcriptomic differences between the 
      two groups were investigated using RNA-seq. Differentially expressed messenger 
      RNAs (mRNAs), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), circular RNAs (circRNAs) and 
      microRNAs (miRNAs) were identified by bioinformatics methods, and functional 
      enrichment analysis with differentially expressed RNAs was performed to 
      investigate the potential biological mechanisms of OUD. RESULTS: A total of 229 
      mRNAs (115 upregulated, 114 downregulated), 416 lncRNAs (191 upregulated, 225 
      downregulated), 17 circRNAs (16 upregulated, 1 downregulated) and 74 miRNAs (42 
      upregulated, 32 downregulated) were differentially expressed between the OUD 
      group and the healthy control group. Functional enrichment analysis with 
      differentially expressed mRNAs showed that immunity, GnRH secretion, and PI3K-Akt 
      signaling pathways were associated with OUD. Immunity-, JAK-STAT-, and 
      insulin-related pathways were enriched in functional enrichment analysis of 
      target genes predicted by differentially expressed miRNAs. CONCLUSION: We 
      identified hundreds of differentially expressed genes that were enriched in 
      immunity, GnRH secretion and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways. Some genes with 
      significant changes might be used as potential biomarkers for progression and 
      treatment of OUD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Electronic cigarettes (e-cigs) vaping, cigarette smoke, and waterpipe 
      tobacco smoking are associated with various cardiopulmonary diseases. microRNAs 
      are present in higher concentration in exosomes that play an important role in 
      various physiological and pathological functions. We hypothesized that the 
      non-coding RNAs transcript may serve as susceptibility to disease biomarkers by 
      smoking and vaping. METHODS: Plasma exosomes/EVs from cigarette smokers, 
      waterpipe smokers and dual smokers (cigarette and waterpipe) were characterized 
      for their size, morphology and TEM, Nanosight and immunoblot analysis. Exosomal 
      RNA was used for small RNA library preparation and the library was quantified 
      using the High Sensitivity DNA Analysis on the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer system 
      and sequenced using the Illumina NextSeq 500 and were converted to fastq format 
      for mapping genes. RESULTS: Enrichment of various non-coding RNAs that include 
      microRNAs, tRNAs, piRNAs, snoRNAs, snRNAs, Mt-tRNAs, and other biotypes are shown 
      in exosomes. A comprehensive differential expression analysis of miRNAs, tRNAs 
      and piRNAs showed significant changes across different pairwise comparisons. The 
      seven microRNAs that were common and differentially expressed of when all the 
      smoking and vaping groups were compared with non-smokers (NS) are hsa-let-7a-5p, 
      hsa-miR-21-5p, hsa-miR-29b-3p, hsa-let-7f-5p, hsa-miR-143-3p, hsa-miR-30a-5p and 
      hsa-let-7i-5p. The e-cig vs. NS group has differentially expressed 5 microRNAs 
      (hsa-miR-224-5p, hsa-miR-193b-3p, hsa-miR-30e-5p, hsa-miR-423-3p, 
      hsa-miR-365a-3p, and hsa-miR-365b-3p), which are not expressed in other three 
      groups. Gene set enrichment analysis of microRNAs showed significant changes in 
      the top six enriched functions that consisted of biological pathway, biological 
      process, molecular function, cellular component, site of expression and 
      transcription factor in all the groups. Further, the pairwise comparison of tRNAs 
      and piRNA in all these groups revealed significant changes in their expressions. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Plasma exosomes of cigarette smokers, waterpipe smokers, e-cig users 
      and dual smokers have common differential expression of microRNAs which may serve 
      to distinguish smoking and vaping subjects from NS. Among them has-let-7a-5p has 
      high sensitivity and specificity to distinguish NS with the rest of the users, 
      using ROC curve analysis. These findings will pave the way for the utilizing the 
      potential of exosomes/miRNAs as a novel theranostic agents in lung injury and 
      disease caused by tobacco smoking and vaping.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Serum microRNAs (miRNAs) are promising non-invasive biomarkers for 
      diagnosing glioma. However, most reported predictive models are constructed 
      without a large enough sample size, and quantitative expression levels of their 
      constituent serum miRNAs are susceptible to batch effects, decreasing their 
      clinical applicability. METHODS: We propose a general method for detecting 
      qualitative serum predictive biomarkers using a large cohort of miRNA-profiled 
      serum samples (n = 15,460) based on the within-sample relative expression 
      orderings of miRNAs. RESULTS: Two panels of miRNA pairs (miRPairs) were 
      developed. The first was composed of five serum miRPairs (5-miRPairs), reaching 
      100% diagnostic accuracy in three validation sets for distinguishing glioma and 
      non-cancer controls (n = 436: glioma = 236, non-cancers = 200). An additional 
      validation set without glioma samples (non-cancers = 2611) showed a predictive 
      accuracy of 95.9%. The second panel included 32 serum miRPairs (32-miRPairs), 
      reaching 100% diagnostic performance in training set on specifically 
      discriminating glioma from other cancer types (sensitivity = 100%, 
      specificity = 100%, accuracy = 100%), which was reproducible in five validation 
      datasets (n = 3387: glioma = 236, non-glioma cancers = 3151, sensitivity> 97.9%, 
      specificity> 99.5%, accuracy> 95.7%). In other brain diseases, the 5-miRPairs 
      classified all non-neoplastic samples as non-cancer, including stroke (n = 165), 
      Alzheimer's disease (n = 973), and healthy samples (n = 1820), and all neoplastic 
      samples as cancer, including meningioma (n = 16), and primary central nervous 
      system lymphoma samples (n = 39). The 32-miRPairs predicted 82.2 and 92.3% of the 
      two kinds of neoplastic samples as positive, respectively. Based on the Human 
      miRNA tissue atlas database, the glioma-specific 32-miRPairs were significantly 
      enriched in the spinal cord (p = 0.013) and brain (p = 0.015). CONCLUSIONS: The 
      identified 5-miRPairs and 32-miRPairs provide potential population screening and 
      cancer-specific biomarkers for glioma clinical practice.

AB  - Transcription factors (TFs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) are well-characterized 
      trans-acting essential players in gene expression regulation. Growing evidence 
      indicates that TFs and miRNAs can work cooperatively, and their dysregulation has 
      been associated with many diseases including cancer. A unified picture of 
      regulatory interactions of these regulators and their joint target genes would 
      shed light on cancer studies. Although online resources developed to support 
      probing of TF-gene and miRNA-gene interactions are available, online applications 
      for miRNA-TF co-regulatory analysis, especially with a focus on cancers, are 
      lacking. In light of this, we developed a web tool, namely CMTCN (freely 
      available at http://www.cbportal.org/CMTCN), which constructs miRNA-TF 
      co-regulatory networks and conducts comprehensive analyses within the context of 
      particular cancer types. With its user-friendly provision of topological and 
      functional analyses, CMTCN promises to be a reliable and indispensable web tool 
      for biomedical studies.

PG  - W536-W541

AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are one class of important small non-coding RNA molecules and 
      play critical roles in health and disease. Therefore, it is important and 
      necessary to evaluate the functional relationship of miRNAs and then predict 
      novel miRNA-disease associations. For this purpose, here we developed the updated 
      web server MISIM (miRNA similarity) v2.0. Besides a 3-fold increase in data 
      content compared with MISIM v1.0, MISIM v2.0 improved the original MISIM 
      algorithm by implementing both positive and negative miRNA-disease associations. 
      That is, the MISIM v2.0 scores could be positive or negative, whereas MISIM v1.0 
      only produced positive scores. Moreover, MISIM v2.0 achieved an algorithm for 
      novel miRNA-disease prediction based on MISIM v2.0 scores. Finally, MISIM v2.0 
      provided network visualization and functional enrichment analysis for 
      functionally paired miRNAs. The MISIM v2.0 web server is freely accessible at 
      http://www.lirmed.com/misim/.

AB  - Toll‑like receptors (TLRs), which are a class of pattern‑recognition receptors, 
      can sense specific molecules of pathogens and then activate immune cells, such as 
      neutrophils. The regulation of TLR signaling in immune cells has been 
      investigated by various studies. However, the interaction of TLR 
      signaling‑activated microRNAs (miRNAs) and genes has not been well investigated 
      in a specific type of immune cells. In the present study, neutrophils were 
      isolated from peripheral blood of a healthy donor, and then treated for 16 h with 
      Staphylococcus aureus lipoteichoic acid (LTA), which is an agonist of TLR2. The 
      miRNA and mRNA expression profiles were analyzed via next‑generation sequencing 
      and bioinformatics approaches. A total of 290 differentially expressed genes 
      between LTA‑treated and vehicle‑treated neutrophils were identified. Gene 
      ontology analysis revealed that various biological processes and pathways, 
      including inflammatory responses, defense response, positive regulation of cell 
      migration, motility, and locomotion, and cell surface receptor signaling pathway, 
      were significantly enriched. In addition, 38 differentially expressed miRNAs were 
      identified and predicted to be involved in regulating signal transduction and 
      cell communication. The interaction of 4 miRNAs (hsa‑miR‑34a‑5p, hsa‑miR‑34c‑5p, 
      hsa‑miR‑708‑5p, and hsa‑miR‑1271‑5p) and 5 genes (MET, CACNB3, TNS3, TTYH3, and 
      HBEGF) was proposed to participate in the LTA‑induced signaling network. The 
      present findings may provide novel information for understanding the detailed 
      expression profiles and potential networks between miRNAs and their target genes 
      in LTA‑stimulated healthy neutrophils.

AB  - Depression as a common complication of brain tumors. Is there a possible common 
      pathogenesis for depression and glioma? The most serious major depressive 
      disorder (MDD) and glioblastoma (GBM) in both diseases are studied, to explore 
      the common pathogenesis between the two diseases. In this article, we first rely 
      on transcriptome data to obtain reliable and useful differentially expressed 
      genes (DEGs) by differential expression analysis. Then, we used the 
      transcriptomics of DEGs to find out and analyze the common pathway of MDD and GBM 
      from three directions. Finally, we determine the important biological pathways 
      that are common to MDD and GBM by statistical knowledge. Our findings provide the 
      first direct transcriptomic evidence that common pathway in two diseases for the 
      common pathogenesis of the human MDD and GBM. Our results provide a new reference 
      methods and values for the study of the pathogenesis of depression and 
      glioblastoma.

AB  - MicroRNAs are regulators of gene expressionand may be key markers in liquid 
      biopsy.Early diagnosis is an effective means to increase patients' overall 
      survival. We generated genome-wide miRNA profiles from serum of patients and 
      controls from the population-based Janus Serum Bank (JSB) and analysed them by 
      bioinformatics and artificial intelligence approaches. JSB contains sera from 
      318,628 originally healthy persons, more than 96,000 of whom developed cancer. We 
      selected 210 serum samples from patients with lung, colon or breast cancer at 
      three time points prior to diagnosis (up to 32 years prior to diagnosis with 
      median 5 years interval between TPs), one time-point after diagnosis and from 
      individually matched controls. The controls were matched on age and year of all 
      pre-diagnostic sampling time-points for the corresponding case. Using ANOVA we 
      report 70 significantly deregulated markers (adjusted p-value<0.05). The driver 
      for the significance was the diagnostic time point (miR-575, miR-6821-5p, miR-630 
      with adjusted p-values<10(-10)). Further, 91miRNAs were differently expressed in 
      pre-diagnostic samples as compared to controls (nominal p < 0.05). Self-organized 
      maps (SOMs)indicated larges effects in lung cancer samples while breast cancer 
      samples showed the least pronounced changes. SOMsalsohighlighted cancer and time 
      point specific miRNA dys-regulation. Intriguingly, a detailed breakdown of the 
      results highlighted that 51% of all miRNAs were highly specific, either for a 
      time-point or a cancer entity. Pathway analysis highlighted 12 pathways including 
      Hipo signalling and ABC transporters.Our results indicate that tumours may be 
      indicated by serum miRNAs decades prior the clinical manifestation.

TI  - Hyperglycemia Affects miRNAs Expression Pattern during Adipogenesis of Human 
      Visceral Adipocytes-Is Memorization Involved?
LID - 10.3390/nu10111774 [doi]
LID - 1774
AB  - microRNAs are increasingly analyzed in adipogenesis, whose deregulation, 
      especially visceral, contributes to the development of diabetes. Hyperglycemia is 
      known to affect cells while occurring acutely and chronically. Therefore, we 
      aimed to evaluate the effect of hyperglycemia on human visceral pre/adipocytes 
      from the perspective of microRNAs. The relative expression of 78 microRNAs was 
      determined by TaqMan Low Density Arrays at three stages of HPA-v adipogenesis 
      conducted under normoglycemia, chronic, and intermittent hyperglycemia (30 mM). 
      Hierarchical clustering/Pearson correlation revealed the relationship between 
      various microRNAs' expression profiles, while functional analysis identified the 
      genes and signaling pathways regulated by differentially expressed microRNAs. 
      Hyperglycemia affected microRNAs' expression patterns during adipogenesis, and at 
      the stage of pre-adipocytes, differentiated and matured adipocytes compared to 
      normoglycemia. Interestingly, the changes that were evoked upon hyperglycemic 
      exposure during one adipogenesis stage resembled those observed upon chronic 
      hyperglycemia. At least 15 microRNAs were modulated during normoglycemic and/or 
      hyperglycemic adipogenesis and/or upon intermittent/chronic hyperglycemia. 
      Bioinformatics analysis revealed the involvement of these microRNAs in cell 
      cycles, lipid metabolism, ECM⁻receptor interaction, oxidative stress, signaling 
      of insulin, MAPK, TGF-β, p53, and more. The obtained data suggests that visceral 
      pre/adipocytes exposed to chronic/intermittent hyperglycemia develop a microRNAs' 
      expression pattern, which may contribute to further visceral dysfunction, the 
      progression of diabetic phenotype, and diabetic complications possibly involving 
      "epi"-memory.

TI  - CoolMPS: evaluation of antibody labeling based massively parallel non-coding RNA 
      sequencing.
PG  - e10
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkaa1122 [doi]
AB  - Results of massive parallel sequencing-by-synthesis vary depending on the 
      sequencing approach. CoolMPS™ is a new sequencing chemistry that incorporates 
      bases by labeled antibodies. To evaluate the performance, we sequenced 240 human 
      non-coding RNA samples (dementia patients and controls) with and without CoolMPS. 
      The Q30 value as indicator of the per base sequencing quality increased from 91.8 
      to 94%. The higher quality was reached across the whole read length. Likewise, 
      the percentage of reads mapping to the human genome increased from 84.9 to 86.2%. 
      For both technologies, we computed similar distributions between different RNA 
      classes (miRNA, piRNA, tRNA, snoRNA and yRNA) and within the classes. While 
      standard sequencing-by-synthesis allowed to recover more annotated miRNAs, 
      CoolMPS yielded more novel miRNAs. The correlation between the two methods was 
      0.97. Evaluating the diagnostic performance, we observed lower minimal P-values 
      for CoolMPS (adjusted P-value of 0.0006 versus 0.0004) and larger effect sizes 
      (Cohen's d of 0.878 versus 0.9). Validating 19 miRNAs resulted in a correlation 
      of 0.852 between CoolMPS and reverse transcriptase-quantitative polymerase chain 
      reaction. Comparison to data generated with Illumina technology confirmed a known 
      shift in the overall RNA composition. With CoolMPS we evaluated a novel 
      sequencing-by-synthesis technology showing high performance for the analysis of 
      non-coding RNAs.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Although noncoding RNAs, especially the microRNAs, have been found to 
      play key roles in CRC development in intestinal tissue, the specific mechanism of 
      these microRNAs has not been fully understood. METHODS: GEO and TCGA database 
      were used to explore the microRNA expression profiles of normal mucosa, adenoma, 
      and carcinoma. And the differential expression genes were selected. 
      Computationally, we built the SVM model and multivariable Cox regression model to 
      evaluate the performance of tumorigenic microRNAs in discriminating the adenomas 
      from normal tissues and risk prediction. RESULTS: In this study, we identified 20 
      miRNA biomarkers dysregulated in the colon adenomas. The functional enrichment 
      analysis showed that MAPK activity and MAPK cascade were highly enriched by these 
      tumorigenic microRNAs. We also investigated the target genes of the tumorigenic 
      microRNAs. Eleven genes, including PIGF, TPI1, KLF4, RARS, PCBP2, EIF5A, HK2, 
      RAVER2, HMGN1, MAPK6, and NDUFA2, were identified to be frequently targeted by 
      the tumorigenic microRNAs. The high AUC value and distinct overall survival rates 
      between the two risk groups suggested that these tumorigenic microRNAs had the 
      potential of diagnostic and prognostic value in CRC. CONCLUSIONS: The present 
      study revealed possible mechanisms and pathways that may contribute to 
      tumorigenesis of CRC, which could not only be used as CRC early detection 
      biomarkers, but also be useful for tumorigenesis mechanism studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: miRNAs regulate the expression of several genes with one miRNA able 
      to target multiple genes and with one gene able to be simultaneously targeted by 
      more than one miRNA. Therefore, it has become indispensable to shorten the long 
      list of miRNA-target interactions to put in the spotlight in order to gain 
      insight into understanding the regulatory mechanism orchestrated by miRNAs in 
      various cellular processes. A reasonable solution is certainly to prioritize 
      miRNA-target interactions to maximize the effectiveness of the downstream 
      analysis. RESULTS: We propose a new and easy-to-use web tool MIENTURNET (MicroRNA 
      ENrichment TURned NETwork) that receives in input a list of miRNAs or mRNAs and 
      tackles the problem of prioritizing miRNA-target interactions by performing a 
      statistical analysis followed by a fully featured network-based visualization and 
      analysis. The statistics is used to assess the significance of an 
      over-representation of miRNA-target interactions and then MIENTURNET filters 
      based on the statistical significance associated with each miRNA-target 
      interaction. In addition, the holistic approach of the network theory is used to 
      infer possible evidences of miRNA regulation by capturing emergent properties of 
      the miRNA-target regulatory network that would be not evident through a pairwise 
      analysis of the individual components. CONCLUSION: MIENTURNET offers the 
      possibility to consistently perform both statistical and network-based analyses 
      by using only a single tool leading to a more effective prioritization of the 
      miRNA-target interactions. This has the potential to avoid researchers without 
      computational and informatics skills to navigate multiple websites and thus to 
      independently investigate miRNA activity in every cellular process of interest in 
      an easy and at the same time exhaustive way thanks to the intuitive web 
      interface. The web application along with a well-documented and comprehensive 
      user guide are freely available at

AB  - Cancer is a complex disease residing in various tissues of human body, 
      accompanied with many abnormalities and mutations in genomes, transcriptome, and 
      epigenome. Early detection plays a crucial role in extending survival time of all 
      major cancer types. Recent advances in microarray and sequencing techniques have 
      given more support to identifying effective biomarkers for early detection of 
      cancer. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are more and more frequently used as candidates for 
      biomarkers in cancer related studies due to their regulation of target gene 
      expression. In this paper, the comparative analysis is used to discover miRNA 
      expression patterns in cancer versus normal samples on early stage of eight 
      prevalent cancer types. Our work focuses on the specific miRNAs biomarkers 
      identification and function analysis. Several identified miRNA biomarkers in this 
      paper are matched well with those reported in existing researches, and most of 
      them could serve as potential candidate indicators for clinical early diagnosis 
      applications.

TI  - An integrated approach to understand fluid shear stress-driven and reactive 
      oxygen species-mediated metastasis of colon adenocarcinoma through 
      mRNA-miRNA-lncRNA-circRNA networks.
PG  - 1353-1370
LID - 10.1007/s00438-022-01924-z [doi]
AB  - Development of colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) metastasis involves several mediators 
      including fluid shear stress (FSS), intracellular ROS levels, and non-coding 
      RNAs. In our present study, we identified and investigated the role of regulatory 
      non-coding RNA molecules specifically involved in COAD metastasis and their 
      association with FSS and ROS. Interactions between the mRNAs associated with FSS 
      and ROS, the corresponding microRNAs (miRNAs), long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and 
      circular RNAs (circRNAs) in COAD metastasis were used to generate the 
      mRNA-miRNA-lncRNA-circRNA network. Experimental validation of the identified RNA 
      hubs using quantitative real-time PCR demonstrated a direct effect of the FSS on 
      their expression levels in cancer cells. FSS resulted in the downregulation of 
      HMGA1 and RAN, as well as the upregulation of HSP90AA1, PMAIP1 and BIRC5. 
      Application of shear stress also led to downregulation of hsa-miR-26b-5p and 
      hsa-miR-34a-5p levels in HCT116 cells. Further, functional enrichment and 
      survival analysis of the significant miRNAs, as well as the OncoPrint and the 
      survival analyses of the selected mRNAs were performed. Subsequently, their 
      functional role was also corroborated with existing literature. Ten significant 
      miRNA hubs were identified, out of which hsa-miR-17-5p and hsa-miR-20a-5p were 
      found to interact with lncRNA (CCAT2) while hsa-miR-335 was found to interact 
      with four circRNAs. Fifteen significant miRNAs were identified in 10 different 
      modules suggesting their importance in FSS and ROS-mediated COAD metastasis. 
      Finally, 10 miRNAs and 3 mRNAs associated with FSS and/or ROS were identified as 
      significant overall survival markers; 33 mRNAs were also identified as 
      metastasis-free survival markers whereas 15 mRNAs showed > 10% gene alterations 
      in TCGA-COAD data and may serve as promising therapeutic biomarkers in the COAD 
      metastasis.

TI  - Exploring the Regulatory Potential of Long Non-Coding RNA in Feed Efficiency of 
      Indicine Cattle.
LID - 10.3390/genes11090997 [doi]
LID - 997
AB  - Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) can regulate several aspects of gene expression, 
      being associated with complex phenotypes in humans and livestock species. In 
      taurine beef cattle, recent evidence points to the involvement of lncRNA in feed 
      efficiency (FE), a proxy for increased productivity and sustainability. Here, we 
      hypothesized specific regulatory roles of lncRNA in FE of indicine cattle. Using 
      RNA-Seq data from the liver, muscle, hypothalamus, pituitary gland and adrenal 
      gland from Nellore bulls with divergent FE, we submitted new transcripts to a 
      series of filters to confidently predict lncRNA. Then, we identified lncRNA that 
      were differentially expressed (DE) and/or key regulators of FE. Finally, we 
      explored lncRNA genomic location and interactions with miRNA and mRNA to infer 
      potential function. We were able to identify 126 relevant lncRNA for FE in Bos 
      indicus, some with high homology to previously identified lncRNA in Bos taurus 
      and some possible specific regulators of FE in indicine cattle. Moreover, lncRNA

AB  - Objective. Icariin plays a pivotal role in ameliorating atherosclerosis for 
      animal models although its comprehensive biological role remains largely 
      unexplored. This study aimed to fully understand the effects of icariin on 
      atherosclerosis in high-fat diet-induced ApoE(-/-) mice and investigate 
      mRNA-miRNA regulation based on microarray and bioinformatics analysis. Methods. 
      The areas of atherosclerotic lesions in en face aorta were evaluated. Microarray 
      analysis was performed on atherosclerotic aortic tissues. The integrative 
      analysis of mRNA and miRNA profiling was utilized to suggest specific functions 
      of gene and supply an integrated and corresponding method to study the protective 
      effect of icariin on atherosclerosis. Results. Icariin attenuated the development 
      of atherosclerosis that the mean atherosclerotic lesion area was reduced by 5.8% 
      (P < 0.05). Significant changes were observed in mRNA and miRNA expression 
      patterns. Several miRNAs obtained from the miRNA-Gene-Network might play 
      paramount part in antiatherosclerotic effect of icariin, such as mmu-miR-6931-5p, 
      mmu-miR-3547-5p, mmu-miR-5107-5p, mmu-miR-6368, and mmu-miR-7118-5p. Specific 
      miRNAs and GO terms associated with icariin in the pathogenesis of 
      atherosclerosis were validated using GO analysis and miRNA-GO-Network. 
      MiRNA-Pathway-Network indicated that icariin induced miRNAs mainly regulate the 
      signaling pathways of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, Ras signaling pathway, ErbB 
      signaling pathway, and VEGF signaling pathway in aorta atherosclerotic lesion. 
      Conclusions. Our data provides evidence that icariin is able to exhibit one 
      antiatherosclerotic action by mediating multiple biological processes or 
      cascades, suggesting the pleiotropic effects of icariin in atherosclerosis 
      alleviation. The identified gene functional categories and pathways are 
      potentially valuable targets for future development of RNA-guided gene regulation 
      to fight disease.

TI  - Low miR-150-5p and miR-320b Expression Predicts Reduced Survival of COPD 
      Patients.
LID - 10.3390/cells8101162 [doi]
LID - 1162
AB  - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated with an increased risk 
      of death, reducing life expectancy on average between 5 and 7 years. The survival 
      time after diagnosis, however, varies considerably as a result of the 
      heterogeneity of COPD. Therefore, markers that predict individual survival of 
      COPD patients are of great value. We analyzed baseline molecular profiles and 
      collected 54 months of follow-up data of the cohort study "COPD and SYstemic 
      consequences-COmorbidities NETwork" (COSYCONET). Genome-wide microRNA signatures 
      from whole blood collected at time of the inclusion in the study were generated 
      for 533 COPD patients including patients that deceased during the 54-month 
      follow-up period (n = 53) and patients that survived this period (n = 480). We 
      identified two blood-born microRNAs (miR-150-5p and miR-320b) that were highly 
      predictive for survival of COPD patients. The expression change was then 
      confirmed by RT-qPCR in 245 individuals. Ninety percent of patients with highest 
      expression of miR-150-5p survived the 54-month period in contrast to only 50% of 
      patients with lowest expression intensity. Moreover, the abundance of the 
      oncogenic miR-150-5p in blood of COPD patients was predictive for the development 
      of cancer. Thus, molecular profiles measured at the time of a COPD diagnosis have 
      a high predictive power for the survival of patients.

PG  - 2852-2864
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the association of circulating miRNAs 
      profile with the risk of knee osteoarthritis (OA), and evaluate their correlation 
      with clinical characteristics. This study was divided into two parts: exploration 
      stage and validation stage. In exploration stage, 8 knee OA patients and 8 age 
      and gender highly matched health controls (HCs) were recruited, and plasma sample 
      were collected for microarray examination. Differentially expressed miRNAs and 
      enrichment analysis were subsequently performed. In validation stage, 100 knee OA 
      patients and 100 age and gender matched HCs were enrolled, and Top 8 
      differentially expressed miRNAs in microarray were selected for further 
      validation by qPCR. In exploration stage, 41 up-regulated miRNAs and 29 
      down-regulated miRNAs were identified by microarray, and enrichment analysis 
      disclosed these miRNAs were involved in inflammation- and immunity- related 
      process. Top 8 differentially expressed miRNAs in microarray were determined in 
      the validation stage, and miR-19b-3p, miR-92a-3p, miR-122-5p, miR-486-5p and 
      miR-320b expression were increased in knee OA. Univariate and multivariate 
      logistic analysis showed only miR-19b-3p, miR-122-5p and miR-486-5p were 
      independent factors for knee OA risk, and ROC curve showed combination of 
      miR-19b-3p, miR-122-5p and miR-486-5p has a great diagnostic value for knee OA. 
      Besides, miR-19b-3p and miR-486-5p positively correlates with disease severity. 
      This study revealed that circulating miRNA profiles played a key role in knee OA 
      diagnosis, and combined measurement of miR-19b-3p, miR-122-5p and miR-486-5p 
      could be served as a novel and promising biomarker for diagnosis and disease 
      severity of knee OA.

TI  - Multi-level transcriptome sequencing identifies COL1A1 as a candidate marker in 
      human heart failure progression.
PG  - 2

AB  - BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) has been recognized as a global pandemic with a 
      high rate of hospitalization, morbidity, and mortality. Although numerous 
      advances have been made, its representative molecular signatures remain largely 
      unknown, especially the role of genes in HF progression. The aim of the present 
      prospective follow-up study was to reveal potential biomarkers associated with 
      the progression of heart failure. METHODS: We generated multi-level 
      transcriptomic data from a cohort of left ventricular heart tissue collected from 
      21 HF patients and 9 healthy donors. By using Masson staining to calculate the 
      fibrosis percentage for each sample, we applied lasso regression model to 
      identify the genes associated with fibrosis as well as progression. The genes 
      were further validated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining in the same cohort 
      and qRT-PCR using another independent cohort (20 HF and 9 healthy donors). 
      Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to measure the plasma level in 
      a validation cohort (139 HF patients) for predicting HF progression. RESULTS: 
      Based on the multi-level transcriptomic data, we examined differentially 
      expressed genes [mRNAs, microRNAs, and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs)] in the 
      study cohort. The follow-up functional annotation and regulatory network analyses 
      revealed their potential roles in regulating extracellular matrix. We further 
      identified several genes that were associated with fibrosis. By using the 
      survival time before transplantation, COL1A1 was identified as a potential 
      biomarker for HF progression and its upregulation was confirmed by both IHC and 
      qRT-PCR. Furthermore, COL1A1 content ≥ 256.5 ng/ml in plasma was found to be 
      associated with poor survival within 1 year of heart transplantation from heart 
      failure [hazard ratio (HR) 7.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.5 to 15.8, 
      Log-rank p value < 1.0 × 10(- 4)]. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggested that COL1A1 
      might be a plasma biomarker of HF and associated with HF progression, especially 
      to predict the 1-year survival from HF onset to transplantation.

AB  - 20-40% of lung cancer patients develop bone metastasis (BM) with significantly 
      decreased overall survival. Currently, BM is mainly diagnosed by computerized 
      tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) when symptom develops. 
      Novel biomarkers with higher prediction value of BM are needed. Plasma-derived 
      exosomal microRNAs had been isolated and sequenced of total 30 non-small cell 
      lung cancer (NSCLC) patients including 16 with bone metastasis and 14 without 
      bone metastasis. Hierarchical clustering based on the total miRNA profile can 
      clearly separate cancer patients and healthy individuals (H), but not patients 
      with (BM +) or without (BM-) BM. Weight Co-expression network of miRNAs (WGCNA) 
      analyses identified three consensus clusters (A, B, C) of highly correlated 
      miRNAs, among which cluster B (144 miRNAs) showed significantly differential 
      expression in lung cancer patients, especially in BM + group. Pathway analysis of 
      cluster B miRNAs revealed enrichment in metabolic pathways that may involve in 
      preconditioning of the metastatic niche. Three differentially expressed miRNAs 
      between BM + and BM- patients within cluster B were identified as miR-574-5p, a 
      suppressor of Wnt/β-catenin pathway, was down-regulated, while miR-328-3p and 
      miR-423-3p, two activators of the same pathway, were up-regulated in 
      BM + patients. Cluster A miRNAs (n = 49) also showed trend of upregulation in 
      BM + patients. Interestingly, pathway analysis indicated that 43 of them are 
      associated with chromosome14, which has been suggested to promote 
      epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and bone metastasis.

AB  - The transcriptome of a tumor contains detailed information about the disease. 
      Although advances in sequencing technologies have generated larger data sets, 
      there are still many questions about exactly how the transcriptome is regulated. 
      One class of regulatory elements consists of microRNAs (or miRs), many of which 
      are known to be associated with cancer. To better understand the relationships 
      between miRs and cancers, we analyzed ∼9000 samples from 32 cancer types studied 
      in The Cancer Genome Atlas. Our feature reduction algorithm found evidence for 21 
      biologically interpretable clusters of miRs, many of which were statistically 
      associated with a specific type of cancer. Moreover, the clusters contain 
      sufficient information to distinguish between most types of cancer. We then used 
      linear models to measure, genome-wide, how much variation in gene expression 
      could be explained by the 21 average expression values ("scores") of the 
      clusters. Based on the ∼20,000 per-gene R(2) values, we found that (1) mean 
      differences between tissues of origin explain about 36% of variation; (2) the 21 
      miR cluster scores explain about 30% of the variation; and (3) combining tissue 
      type with the miR scores explained about 56% of the total genome-wide variation 
      in gene expression. Our analysis of poorly explained genes shows that they are 
      enriched for olfactory receptor processes, sensory perception, and nervous system 
      processing, which are necessary to receive and interpret signals from outside the 
      organism. Therefore, it is reasonable for those genes to be always active and not 
      get downregulated by miRs. In contrast, highly explained genes are characterized 
      by genes translating to proteins necessary for transport, plasma membrane, or 
      metabolic processes that are heavily regulated processes inside the cell. Other 
      genetic regulatory elements such as transcription factors and methylation might 
      help explain some of the remaining variation in gene expression.

LID - 2456076
AB  - miRNAs are a class of noncoding RNAs important in posttranscriptional repressors 
      and involved in the regulation of almost every biological process by base paring 
      with target genes through sequence in their seed regions. Genetic variations in 
      the seed regions have vital effects on gene expression, phenotypic variation, and 
      disease susceptibility in humans. The distribution pattern of genetic variation 
      in miRNA seed regions might be related to miRNA function and is worth paying more 
      attention to. We here employed computational analyses to explore the clustering 
      pattern and functional effect of SNPs in human miRNA seed regions. A total of 
      1879 SNPs were mapped to 1226 human miRNA seed regions. We found that miRNAs with 
      SNPs in their seed region are significantly enriched in miRNA clusters. We also 
      found that SNPs in clustered miRNA seed regions have a lower functional effect 
      than have SNPs in nonclustered miRNA seed regions. Additionally, we found that 
      clustered miRNAs with SNPs in seed regions are involved in more pathways. 
      Overall, our results demonstrate that SNPs in clustered miRNA seed regions can 
      take part in more intricate and complex gene-regulating networks with lower 
      functional cost by functional complementarity. Moreover, our results also broaden 
      current knowledge on the genetic variation in human miRNA seed regions.

      datasets.
PG  - W252-W261
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkaa259 [doi]
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that are involved in the regulation 
      of major pathways in eukaryotic cells through their binding to and repression of 
      multiple mRNAs. With high-throughput methodologies, various outcomes can be 
      measured that produce long lists of miRNAs that are often difficult to interpret. 
      A common question is: after differential expression or phenotypic screening of 
      miRNA mimics, which miRNA should be chosen for further investigation? Here, we 
      present miRViz (http://mirviz.prabi.fr/), a webserver application designed to 
      visualize and interpret large miRNA datasets, with no need for programming 
      skills. MiRViz has two main goals: (i) to help biologists to raise data-driven 
      hypotheses and (ii) to share miRNA datasets in a straightforward way through 
      publishable quality data representation, with emphasis on relevant groups of 
      miRNAs. MiRViz can currently handle datasets from 11 eukaryotic species. We 
      present real-case applications of miRViz, and provide both datasets and 
      procedures to reproduce the corresponding figures. MiRViz offers rapid 
      identification of miRNA families, as demonstrated here for the miRNA-320 family, 
      which is significantly exported in exosomes of colon cancer cells. We also 
      visually highlight a group of miRNAs associated with pluripotency that is 
      particularly active in control of a breast cancer stem-cell population in 
      culture.

TI  - miRBaseConverter: an R/Bioconductor package for converting and retrieving miRNA 
      name, accession, sequence and family information in different versions of 
      miRBase.
PG  - 514

AB  - BACKGROUND: miRBase is the primary repository for published miRNA sequence and 
      annotation data, and serves as the "go-to" place for miRNA research. However, the 
      definition and annotation of miRNAs have been changed significantly across 
      different versions of miRBase. The changes cause inconsistency in miRNA related 
      data between different databases and articles published at different times. 
      Several tools have been developed for different purposes of querying and 
      converting the information of miRNAs between different miRBase versions, but none 
      of them individually can provide the comprehensive information about miRNAs in 
      miRBase and users will need to use a number of different tools in their analyses. 
      RESULTS: We introduce miRBaseConverter, an R package integrating the latest 
      miRBase version 22 available in Bioconductor to provide a suite of functions for 
      converting and retrieving miRNA name (ID), accession, sequence, species, version 
      and family information in different versions of miRBase. The package is 
      implemented in R and available under the GPL-2 license from the Bioconductor 
      website ( http://bioconductor.org/packages/miRBaseConverter/ ). A Shiny-based GUI 
      suitable for non-R users is also available as a standalone application from the 
      package and also as a web application at 
      http://nugget.unisa.edu.au:3838/miRBaseConverter . miRBaseConverter has a 
      built-in database for querying miRNA information in all species and for both 
      pre-mature and mature miRNAs defined by miRBase. In addition, it is the first 
      tool for batch querying the miRNA family information. The package aims to provide 
      a comprehensive and easy-to-use tool for miRNA research community where 
      researchers often utilize published miRNA data from different sources. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The Bioconductor package miRBaseConverter and the Shiny-based web 
      application are presented to provide a suite of functions for converting and 
      retrieving miRNA name, accession, sequence, species, version and family 
      information in different versions of miRBase. The package will serve a wide range 
      of applications in miRNA research and could provide a full view of the miRNAs of 
      interest.

TI  - miEAA 2.0: integrating multi-species microRNA enrichment analysis and workflow 
      management systems.
PG  - W521-W528
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkaa309 [doi]
AB  - Gene set enrichment analysis has become one of the most frequently used 
      applications in molecular biology research. Originally developed for gene sets, 
      the same statistical principles are now available for all omics types. In 2016, 
      we published the miRNA enrichment analysis and annotation tool (miEAA) for human 
      precursor and mature miRNAs. Here, we present miEAA 2.0, supporting miRNA input 
      from ten frequently investigated organisms. To facilitate inclusion of miEAA in 
      workflow systems, we implemented an Application Programming Interface (API). 
      Users can perform miRNA set enrichment analysis using either the web-interface, a 
      dedicated Python package, or custom remote clients. Moreover, the number of 
      category sets was raised by an order of magnitude. We implemented novel 
      categories like annotation confidence level or localisation in biological 
      compartments. In combination with the miRBase miRNA-version and 
      miRNA-to-precursor converters, miEAA supports research settings where older 
      releases of miRBase are in use. The web server also offers novel comprehensive 
      visualizations such as heatmaps and running sum curves with background 
      distributions. We demonstrate the new features with case studies for human kidney 
      cancer, a biomarker study on Parkinson's disease from the PPMI cohort, and a 
      mouse model for breast cancer. The tool is freely accessible at: 
      https://www.ccb.uni-saarland.de/mieaa2.

TI  - DeepMiR2GO: Inferring Functions of Human MicroRNAs Using a Deep Multi-Label 
      Classification Model.
LID - 10.3390/ijms20236046 [doi]
LID - 6046
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a highly abundant collection of functional non-coding RNAs 
      involved in cellular regulation and various complex human diseases. Although a 
      large number of miRNAs have been identified, most of their physiological 
      functions remain unknown. Computational methods play a vital role in exploring 
      the potential functions of miRNAs. Here, we present DeepMiR2GO, a tool for 
      integrating miRNAs, proteins and diseases, to predict the gene ontology (GO) 
      functions based on multiple deep neuro-symbolic models. DeepMiR2GO starts by 
      integrating the miRNA co-expression network, protein-protein interaction (PPI) 
      network, disease phenotype similarity network, and interactions or associations 
      among them into a global heterogeneous network. Then, it employs an efficient 
      graph embedding strategy to learn potential network representations of the global 
      heterogeneous network as the topological features. Finally, a deep multi-label 
      classification network based on multiple neuro-symbolic models is built and used 
      to annotate the GO terms of miRNAs. The predicted results demonstrate that 
      DeepMiR2GO performs significantly better than other state-of-the-art approaches 
      in terms of precision, recall, and maximum F-measure.

TI  - Chronic Voluntary Ethanol Drinking in Cynomolgus Macaques Elicits Gene Expression 
      Changes in Prefrontal Cortical Area 46.
PG  - 470-478
LID - 10.1111/acer.14259 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Genome-wide profiling to examine brain transcriptional features 
      associated with excessive ethanol (EtOH) consumption has been applied to a 
      variety of species including rodents, nonhuman primates (NHPs), and humans. 
      However, these data were obtained from cross-sectional samples which are 
      particularly vulnerable to individual variation when obtained from small outbred 
      populations typical of human and NHP studies. In the current study, a novel 
      within-subject design was used to examine the effects of voluntary EtOH 
      consumption on prefrontal cortex (PFC) gene expression in a NHP model. METHODS: 
      Two cohorts of cynomolgus macaques (n = 23) underwent a schedule-induced 
      polydipsia procedure to establish EtOH self-administration followed by 6 months 
      of daily open access to EtOH (4% w/v) and water. Individual daily EtOH intakes 
      ranged from an average of 0.7 to 3.7 g/kg/d. Dorsal lateral PFC area 46 (A46) 
      brain biopsies were collected in EtOH-naïve and control monkeys; contralateral 
      A46 biopsies were collected from the same monkeys following the 6 months of fluid 
      consumption. Gene expression changes were assessed using RNA-Seq paired analysis, 
      which allowed for correction of individual baseline differences in gene 
      expression. RESULTS: A total of 675 genes were significantly down-regulated 
      following EtOH consumption; these were functionally enriched for immune response, 
      cell adhesion, plasma membrane, and extracellular matrix. A total of 567 genes 
      that were up-regulated following EtOH consumption were enriched in microRNA 
      target sites and included target sites associated with Toll-like receptor 
      pathways. The differentially expressed genes were also significantly enriched in 
      transcription factor binding sites. CONCLUSIONS: The data presented here are the 
      first to use a longitudinal biopsy strategy to examine how chronic EtOH 
      consumption affects gene expression in the primate PFC. Prominent effects were 
      seen in both cell adhesion and neuroimmune pathways; the latter contained both 
      pro- and antiinflammatory genes. The data also indicate that changes in miRNAs 
      and transcription factors may be important epigenetic regulators of EtOH 
      consumption.

AB  - Angiogenin (ANG) is a secretory ribonuclease that promotes the proliferation of 
      endothelial cells, leading to angiogenesis. This function relies on its 
      ribonucleolytic activity, which is low for simple RNA substrates. Upon entry into 
      the cytosol, ANG is sequestered by the ribonuclease inhibitor protein (RNH1). We 
      find that ANG is a potent cytotoxin for RNH1-knockout HeLa cells, belying its 
      inefficiency as a nonspecific catalyst. The toxicity does, however, rely on the 
      ribonucleolytic activity of ANG and a cytosolic localization, which lead to the 
      accumulation of particular tRNA fragments (tRFs), such as tRF-5 Gly-GCC. These 
      up-regulated tRFs are highly cytotoxic at physiological concentrations. Although 
      ANG is well-known for its promotion of cell growth, our results reveal that ANG 
      can also cause cell death.

TI  - Serum miRNA profiles are altered in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis 
      receiving high-dose ursodeoxycholic acid.
PG  - 100729

LID - 100729
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic, progressive 
      cholestatic liver disease that can lead to end-stage liver disease and 
      cholangiocarcinoma. High-dose ursodeoxycholic acid (hd-UDCA, 28-30 mg/kg/day) was 
      evaluated in a previous multicentre, randomised placebo-controlled trial; 
      however, the study was discontinued early because of increased liver-related 
      serious adverse events (SAEs), despite improvement in serum liver biochemical 
      tests. We investigated longitudinal changes in serum miRNA and cytokine profiles 
      over time among patients treated with either hd-UDCA or placebo in this trial as 
      potential biomarkers for PSC and response to hd-UDCA, as well as to understand 
      the toxicity associated with hd-UDCA treatment. METHODS: Thirty-eight patients 
      with PSC were enrolled in a multicentred, randomised, double-blinded trial of 
      hd-UDCA vs. placebo. RESULTS: Significant alterations in serum miRNA profiles 
      were found over time in both patients treated with hd-UDCA or placebo. 
      Additionally, there were striking differences between miRNA profiles in patients 
      treated with hd-UDCA compared with placebo. In patients treated with placebo, the 
      changes in concentration of serum miRNAs miR-26a, miR-199b-5p, miR-373, and 
      miR-663 suggest alterations of inflammatory and cell proliferative processes 
      consistent with disease progression. However, patients treated with hd-UDCA 
      exhibited a more pronounced differential expression of serum miRNAs, suggesting 
      that hd-UDCA induces significant cellular miRNA changes and tissue injury. 
      Pathway enrichment analysis for UDCA-associated miRNAs suggested unique 
      dysregulation of cell cycle and inflammatory response pathways. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Patients with PSC have distinct miRNAs in the serum and bile, although the 
      implications of these unique patterns have not been studied longitudinally or in 
      relation to adverse events related to hd-UDCA. Our study demonstrates marked 
      changes in miRNA serum profiles with hd-UDCA treatment and suggests mechanisms 
      for the increased liver toxicity with therapy. IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS: Using 
      serum samples from patients with PSC enrolled in a clinical trial comparing 
      hd-UDCA with placebo, our study found distinct miRNA changes in patients with PSC 
      who are treated with hd-UDCA over a period of time. Our study also noted distinct 
      miRNA patterns in patients who developed SAEs during the study period.

AB  - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) significantly increases the risk of 
      developing cancer. Biomarker studies frequently follow a case-control set-up in 
      which patients diagnosed with a disease are compared to controls. Longitudinal 
      cohort studies such as the COPD-centered German COPD and SYstemic 
      consequences-COmorbidities NETwork (COSYCONET) study provide the patient and 
      biomaterial base for discovering predictive molecular markers. We asked whether 
      microRNA (miRNA) profiles in blood collected from COPD patients prior to a tumor 
      diagnosis could support an early diagnosis of tumor development independent of 
      the tumor type. From 2741 participants of COSYCONET diagnosed with COPD, we 
      selected 534 individuals including 33 patients who developed cancer during the 
      follow-up period of 54 months and 501 patients who did not develop cancer, but 
      had similar age, gender and smoking history. Genome-wide miRNA profiles were 
      generated and evaluated using machine learning techniques. For patients 
      developing cancer we identified nine miRNAs with significantly decreased 
      abundance (two-tailed unpaired t-test adjusted for multiple testing P < 0.05), 
      including members of the miR-320 family. The identified miRNAs regulate different 
      cancer-related pathways including the MAPK pathway (P = 2.3 × 10(-5)). We also 
      observed the impact of confounding factors on the generated miRNA profiles, 
      underlining the value of our matched analysis. For selected miRNAs, qRT-PCR 
      analysis was applied to validate the results. In conclusion, we identified 
      several miRNAs in blood of COPD patients, which could serve as candidates for 
      biomarkers to help identify COPD patients at risk of developing cancer.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nano-sized particles secreted by 
      most cells. EVs carry nucleic acids that hold promise as potential biomarkers in 
      various diseases. Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV) infects CD4+ T cells 
      and induces immune dysfunction, inflammation, and EV secretion, but little is 
      known about EV small RNA cargo in relation to immune dysregulation in 
      HIV-infected individuals. Here, we characterize small RNA carried by circulating 
      EVs in HIV-positive subjects on antiretroviral therapy (ART) relative to 
      uninfected controls by next-generation RNA sequencing. RESULTS: Plasma EVs 
      isolated from HIV-positive and HIV-negative subjects in test (n = 24) and 
      validation (n = 16) cohorts were characterized by electron microscopy, 
      nanoparticle tracking analysis, and immunoblotting for exosome markers. EVs were 
      more abundant in plasma from HIV-positive compared to HIV-negative subjects. 
      Small RNA sequencing of plasma EVs in the test cohort identified diverse small 
      RNA species including miRNA, piRNA, snRNA, snoRNA, tRNA, and rRNA, with miRNA 
      being the most abundant. A total of 351 different miRNAs were detected in plasma 
      EVs, with the top 50 miRNAs accounting for 90% of all miRNA reads. miR-26a-5p was 
      the most abundant miRNA, followed by miR-21-5p and miR-148-3p. qRT-PCR analysis 
      showed that six miRNAs (miR-10a-5p, - 21-5p, -27b-3p, - 122-5p, -146a-5p, 
      - 423-5p) were significantly increased in plasma EVs from HIV-positive compared 
      to HIV-negative subjects in the validation cohort. Furthermore, miR-21-5p, 
      -27b-3p, -146a-5p, and - 423-5p correlated positively with metabolite markers of 
      oxidative stress and negatively with anti-inflammatory polyunsaturated fatty 
      acids. Over-representation and pathway enrichment analyses of miRNAs and their 
      target genes predicted functional association with oxidative stress responses, 
      interferon gamma signaling, Toll-like receptor signaling, TGF beta signaling, and 
      Notch signaling. CONCLUSIONS: HIV-positive individuals on ART have increased 
      abundance of circulating EVs carrying diverse small RNAs, with miRNAs being the 
      most abundant. Several miRNAs associated with inflammation and oxidative stress 
      are increased in circulating EVs of HIV-positive individuals, representing 
      potential biomarkers of targetable pathways that contribute to disease 
      pathogenesis.

TI  - Reprogramming of Small Noncoding RNA Populations in Peripheral Blood Reveals Host 
      Biomarkers for Latent and Active Mycobacterium tuberculosis Infection.
LID - 10.1128/mBio.01037-19 [doi]
LID - e01037-19
AB  - In tuberculosis (TB), as in other infectious diseases, studies of small noncoding 
      RNAs (sncRNA) in peripheral blood have focused on microRNAs (miRNAs) but have 
      neglected the other major sncRNA classes in spite of their potential functions in 
      host gene regulation. Using RNA sequencing of whole blood, we have therefore 
      determined expression of miRNA, PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA), small nucleolar RNA 
      (snoRNA), and small nuclear RNA (snRNA) in patients with TB (n = 8), latent TB 
      infection (LTBI; n = 21), and treated LTBI (LTBItt; n = 6) and in uninfected 
      exposed controls (ExC; n = 14). As expected, sncRNA reprogramming was greater in 
      TB than in LTBI, with the greatest changes seen in miRNA populations. However, 
      substantial dynamics were also evident in piRNA and snoRNA populations. One miRNA 
      and 2 piRNAs were identified as moderately accurate (area under the curve 
      [AUC] = 0.70 to 0.74) biomarkers for LTBI, as were 1 miRNA, 1 piRNA, and 2 
      snoRNAs (AUC = 0.79 to 0.91) for accomplished LTBI treatment. Logistic regression 
      identified the combination of 4 sncRNA (let-7a-5p, miR-589-5p, miR-196b-5p, and 
      SNORD104) as a highly sensitive (100%) classifier to discriminate TB from all 
      non-TB groups. Notably, it reclassified 8 presumed LTBI cases as TB cases, 5 of 
      which turned out to have features of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection on 
      chest radiographs. SNORD104 expression decreased during M. tuberculosis infection 
      of primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and M2-like (P = 0.03) 
      but not M1-like (P = 0.31) macrophages, suggesting that its downregulation in 
      peripheral blood in TB is biologically relevant. Taken together, the results 
      demonstrate that snoRNA and piRNA should be considered in addition to miRNA as 
      biomarkers and pathogenesis factors in the various stages of TB.IMPORTANCE 
      Tuberculosis is the infectious disease with the worldwide largest disease burden 
      and there remains a great need for better diagnostic biomarkers to detect latent 
      and active M. tuberculosis infection. RNA molecules hold great promise in this 
      regard, as their levels of expression may differ considerably between infected 
      and uninfected subjects. We have measured expression changes in the four major 
      classes of small noncoding RNAs in blood samples from patients with different 
      stages of TB infection. We found that, in addition to miRNAs (which are known to 
      be highly regulated in blood cells from TB patients), expression of piRNA and 
      snoRNA is greatly altered in both latent and active TB, yielding promising 
      biomarkers. Even though the functions of many sncRNA other than miRNA are still 
      poorly understood, our results strongly suggest that at least piRNA and snoRNA 
      populations may represent hitherto underappreciated players in the different 
      stages of TB infection.

TI  - MicroRNA-155 induction via TNF-α and IFN-γ suppresses expression of programmed 
      death ligand-1 (PD-L1) in human primary cells.
PG  - 20683-20693
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M117.809053 [doi]
AB  - Programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) is a critical regulator of T cell function 
      contributing to peripheral immune tolerance. Although it has been shown that 
      posttranscriptional regulatory mechanisms control PD-L1 expression in cancer, it 
      remains unknown whether such regulatory loops operate also in non-transformed 
      cells. Here we studied PD-L1 expression in human dermal lymphatic endothelial 
      cells (HDLECs), which play key roles in immunity and cancer. Treatment of HDLECs 
      with the pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN-γ and TNF-α synergistically up-regulated 
      PD-L1 expression. IFN-γ and TNF-α also affected expression of several microRNAs 
      (miRNAs) that have the potential to suppress PD-L1 expression. The most highly 
      up-regulated miRNA following IFN-γ and TNF-α treatment in HDLECs was miR-155, 
      which has a central role in the immune system and cancer. Induction of miR-155 
      was driven by TNF-α, the effect of which was significantly enhanced by IFN-γ. The 
      PD-L1 3'-UTR contains two functional miR-155-binding sites. Endogenous miR-155 
      controlled the kinetics and maximal levels of PD-L1 induction upon IFN-γ and 
      TNF-α treatments. We obtained similar findings in dermal fibroblasts, 
      demonstrating that the IFN-γ/TNF-α/miR-155/PD-L1 pathway is not restricted to 
      HDLECs. These results reveal miR-155 as a critical component of an 
      inflammation-induced regulatory loop controlling PD-L1 expression in primary 
      cells.

AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been demonstrated to play significant biological roles in 
      many human biological processes. Inferring the functions of miRNAs is an 
      important strategy for understanding disease pathogenesis at the molecular level. 
      In this paper, we propose an integrated model, PmiRGO, to infer the gene ontology 
      (GO) functions of miRNAs by integrating multiple data sources, including the 
      expression profiles of miRNAs, miRNA-target interactions, and protein-protein 
      interactions (PPI). PmiRGO starts by building a global network consisting of 
      three networks. Then, it employs DeepWalk to learn latent representations as 
      network features of the global heterogeneous network. Finally, the SVM-based 
      models are applied to label the GO terms of miRNAs. The experimental results show 
      that PmiRGO has a significantly better performance than existing state-of-the-art 
      methods in terms of F (max) . A case study further demonstrates the feasibility 
      of PmiRGO to annotate the potential functions of miRNAs.

TI  - Systematic Assessment of Blood-Borne MicroRNAs Highlights Molecular Profiles of 
      Endurance Sport and Carbohydrate Uptake.

AB  - Multiple studies endorsed the positive effect of regular exercise on mental and 
      physical health. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying training-induced 
      fitness in combination with personal life-style remain largely unexplored. 
      Circulating biomarkers such as microRNAs (miRNAs) offer themselves for studying 
      systemic and cellular changes since they can be collected from the bloodstream in 
      a low-invasive manner. In Homo sapiens miRNAs are known to regulate a substantial 
      number of protein-coding genes in a post-transcriptional manner and hence are of 
      great interest to understand differential gene expression profiles, offering a 
      cost-effective mechanism to study molecular training adaption, and connecting the 
      dots from genomics to observed phenotypes. Here, we investigated molecular 
      expression patterns of 2549 miRNAs in whole-blood samples from 23 healthy and 
      untrained adult participants of a cross-over study, consisting of eight weeks of 
      endurance training, with several sessions per week, followed by 8 weeks of 
      washout and another 8 weeks of running, using microarrays. Participants were 
      randomly assigned to one of the two study groups, one of which administered 
      carbohydrates before each session in the first training period, and switching the 
      treatment group for the second training period. During running sessions clinical 
      parameters as heartbeat frequency were recorded. This information was extended 
      with four measurements of maximum oxygen uptake (VO 2 max) for each participant. 
      We observed that multiple circulating miRNAs show expression changes after 
      endurance training, leveraging the capability to separate the blood samples by 
      training status. To this end, we demonstrate that most of the variance in miRNA 
      expression can be explained by both common and known biological and technical 
      factors. Our findings highlight six distinct clusters of miRNAs, each exhibiting 
      an oscillating expression profile across the four study timepoints, that can 
      effectively be utilized to predict phenotypic VO 2 max levels. In addition, we 
      identified miR-532-5p as a candidate marker to determine personal alterations in 
      physical training performance on a case-by-case analysis taking the influence of 
      a carbohydrate-rich nutrition into account. In literature, miR-532-5p is known as 
      a common down-regulated miRNA in diabetes and obesity, possibly providing a 
      molecular link between cellular homeostasis, personal fitness levels, and health 
      in aging. We conclude that circulating miRNA expression can be altered due to 
      regular endurance training, independent of the carbohydrate (CHO) availability in 
      the training timeframe. Further validation studies are required to confirm the 
      role of exercise-affected miRNAs and the extraordinary function of miR-532-5p in 
      modulating the metabolic response to a high availability of glucose.

AB  - Arteriovenous (AV) fistulas for hemodialysis can lead to cardiac volume loading 
      and increased serum brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels. Whether short-term AV 
      loop placement in patients undergoing microsurgery has an impact on cardiac 
      biomarkers and circulating microRNAs (miRNAs), potentially indicating an 
      increased hemodynamic risk, remains elusive. Fifteen patients underwent AV loop 
      placement with delayed free flap anastomosis for microsurgical reconstructions of 
      lower extremity soft-tissue defects. N-terminal pro-BNP (NT-proBNP), copeptin 
      (CT-proAVP), and miRNA expression profiles were determined in the peripheral 
      blood before and after AV loop placement. MiRNA expression in the blood was 
      correlated with miRNA expression from AV loop vascular tissue. Serum NT-proBNP 
      and copeptin levels exceeded the upper reference limit after AV loop placement, 
      with an especially strong NT-proBNP increase in patients with preexistent cardiac 
      diseases. A miRNA signature of 4 up-regulated (miR-3198, miR-3127-5p, miR-1305, 
      miR-1288-3p) and 2 down-regulated miRNAs (miR30a-5p, miR-145-5p) which are 
      related to cardiovascular physiology, showed a significant systemic deregulation 
      in blood and venous tissue after AV loop placement. AV loop placement causes 
      serum elevations of NT-proBNP, copeptin as well as specific circulating miRNAs, 
      indicating a potentially increased hemodynamic risk for patients with 
      cardiovascular comorbidities, if free flap anastomosis is delayed.

AB  - The analysis of small RNA NGS data together with the discovery of new small RNAs 
      is among the foremost challenges in life science. For the analysis of raw 
      high-throughput sequencing data we implemented the fast, accurate and 
      comprehensive web-based tool miRMaster. Our toolbox provides a wide range of 
      modules for quantification of miRNAs and other non-coding RNAs, discovering new 
      miRNAs, isomiRs, mutations, exogenous RNAs and motifs. Use-cases comprising 
      hundreds of samples are processed in less than 5 h with an accuracy of 99.4%. An 
      integrative analysis of small RNAs from 1836 data sets (20 billion reads) 
      indicated that context-specific miRNAs (e.g. miRNAs present only in one or few 
      different tissues / cell types) still remain to be discovered while broadly 
      expressed miRNAs appear to be largely known. In total, our analysis of known and 
      novel miRNAs indicated nearly 22 000 candidates of precursors with one or two 
      mature forms. Based on these, we designed a custom microarray comprising 11 872 
      potential mature miRNAs to assess the quality of our prediction. MiRMaster is a 
      convenient-to-use tool for the comprehensive and fast analysis of miRNA NGS data. 
      In addition, our predicted miRNA candidates provided as custom array will allow 
      researchers to perform in depth validation of candidates interesting to them.

PG  - 823

AB  - Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a common malignancy for which there is 
      poor prognosis and limited therapeutic options. The objective was to identify 
      mRNA targets of dysregulated miRNAs in OSCC using integrated analysis and 
      understand molecular abnormality in surgical margins. We used biopsies along the 
      spatial axis from normal tissue defined by narrow band imaging (NBI) through 
      conventional white light (WL) margins to tumour from 18 patients undergoing 
      surgical resection for OSCC. Overall 119 miRNA and 4794 mRNA were differentially 
      expressed along the adjacent normal tissue to tumour axis. Analysis of miRNA 
      profiles demonstrated the NBI margins were molecularly distinct from both the 
      tumour and WL margin. Integrated analysis identified 193 miRNA-mRNA interactions 
      correlated to the spatial axis of NBI-WL-T. We used cross-validation analysis to 
      derive a spatial interactome signature of OSCC comprising 100 putative miRNA-mRNA 
      interactions between 40 miRNA and 96 mRNA. Bioinformatic analysis suggests that 
      miRNA dysregulation in OSCC may contribute to activation of the oncostatin M, 
      BDNF and TGF-β pathways. Our data demonstrates that surgical margins defined by 
      NBI leave less potentially malignant residual tissue. The miRNA-mRNA interactome 
      provides insight into dysregulated miRNA signalling in OSCC and supports 
      molecular definition of tumour margins.

TI  - Correlation of microRNA expression profile with clinical response to tumor 
      necrosis factor inhibitor in treating rheumatoid arthritis patients: A 
      prospective cohort study.
PG  - e22953
LID - 10.1002/jcla.22953 [doi]
LID - e22953
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aimed to explore the correlation of circulating microRNA 
      (miRNA) expression profile with clinical response to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) 
      inhibitor in treating rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. METHODS: Baseline PBMC 
      samples from eight responders and eight non-responders after 24-week TNF 
      inhibitor (etanercept) treatment were subjected to miRNA microarray. Then, top 10 
      dysregulated miRNAs were selected and further validated by quantitative 
      polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) in baseline PBMC samples from 92 RA patients 
      treated with 24-week TNF inhibitor (etanercept). Responders and non-responders 
      were divided referring to the decline in disease activity score in 28 joints. 
      RESULTS: In microarray assay, total 59 upregulated and 78 downregulated miRNAs 
      were identified in responders compared to non-responders, which were mainly 
      enriched in regulating immune- and inflammation-related biological processes and 
      pathways. The top 10 dysregulated miRNAs were as follows: miR-192-5p, 
      miR-146a-5p, miR-19b-3p, miR-320c, miR-335-5p, miR-149-3p, miR-766-3p, let-7a-5p, 
      miR-24-3p, and miR-1226-5p. In qPCR validation, miR-146a-5p was increased, while 
      let-7a-5p was decreased in responders compared with non-responders. Multivariate 
      logistic analysis illuminated that miR-146a-5p and CRP independently correlated 
      with higher clinical response, while let-7a-5p and biologics history 
      independently associated with lower clinical response. Subsequently, receiver 
      operating characteristic curve showed that combination of these four independent 
      factors presented with a great predictive value for clinical response with area 
      under curve: 0.863, 95% CI 0.781-0.945. CONCLUSION: miRNA expression profile is 
      closely implicated in the treatment efficacy of TNF inhibitor, and combined 
      measurement of miR-146a-5p, let-7a-5p, CRP, and biologics history disclosed a 
      great predictive value for clinical response to TNF inhibitor in RA patients.

TI  - An Enrichment Analysis for Cardiometabolic Traits Suggests Non-Random Assignment 
      of Genes to microRNAs.
LID - 10.3390/ijms19113666 [doi]
LID - 3666
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate the expression of the majority of genes. However, it 
      is not known whether they regulate genes in random or are organized according to 
      their function. To this end, we chose cardiometabolic disorders as an example and 
      investigated whether genes associated with cardiometabolic disorders are 
      regulated by a random set of miRNAs or a limited number of them. 
      Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) reaching genome-wide level significance 
      were retrieved from most recent genome-wide association studies on 
      cardiometabolic traits, which were cross-referenced with Ensembl to identify 
      related genes and combined with miRNA target prediction databases (TargetScan, 
      miRTarBase, or miRecords) to identify miRNAs that regulate them. We retrieved 520 
      SNPs, of which 355 were intragenic, corresponding to 304 genes. While we found a 
      higher proportion of genes reported from all GWAS that were predicted targets for 
      miRNAs in comparison to all protein-coding genes (75.1%), the proportion was even 
      higher for cardiometabolic genes (80.6%). Enrichment analysis was performed 
      within each database. We found that cardiometabolic genes were over-represented 
      in target genes for 29 miRNAs (based on TargetScan) and 3 miRNAs (miR-181a, 
      miR-302d and miR-372) (based on miRecords) after Benjamini-Hochberg correction 
      for multiple testing. Our work provides evidence for non-random assignment of 
      genes to miRNAs and supports the idea that miRNAs regulate sets of genes that are 
      functionally related.

TI  - Prediction of the Prognosis of Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma by 
      Cuproptosis-Related lncRNA Signals Based on Machine Learning and Construction of 
      ceRNA Network.
PG  - 4643792
LID - 10.1155/2023/4643792 [doi]
LID - 4643792
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clear cell renal cell carcinoma's (ccRCC) occurrence and development 
      are strongly linked to the metabolic reprogramming of tumors, and thus far, 
      neither its prognosis nor treatment has achieved satisfying clinical outcomes. 
      METHODS: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) 
      databases, respectively, provided us with information on the RNA expression of 
      ccRCC patients and their clinical data. Cuproptosis-related genes (CRGS) were 
      discovered in recent massive research. With the help of log-rank testing and 
      univariate Cox analysis, the prognostic significance of CRGS was examined. 
      Different cuproptosis subtypes were identified using consensus clustering 
      analysis, and GSVA was used to further investigate the likely signaling pathways 
      between various subtypes. Univariate Cox, least absolute shrinkage and selection 
      operator (Lasso), random forest (RF), and multivariate stepwise Cox regression 
      analysis were used to build prognostic models. After that, the models were 
      verified by means of the C index, Kaplan-Meier (K-M) survival curves, and 
      time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The association 
      between prognostic models and the tumor immune microenvironment as well as the 
      relationship between prognostic models and immunotherapy were next examined using 
      ssGSEA and TIDE analysis. Four online prediction websites-Mircode, MiRDB, 
      MiRTarBase, and TargetScan-were used to build a lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA ceRNA network. 
      RESULTS: By consensus clustering, two subgroups of cuproptosis were identified 
      that represented distinct prognostic and immunological microenvironments. 
      CONCLUSION: A prognostic risk model with 13 CR-lncRNAs was developed. The immune 
      microenvironment and responsiveness to immunotherapy are substantially connected 
      with the model, which may reliably predict the prognosis of patients with ccRCC.

TI  - A Pilot Study on MicroRNA Profile in Tear Fluid to Predict Response to Anti-VEGF 
      Treatments for Diabetic Macular Edema.
LID - 10.3390/jcm9092920 [doi]
LID - 2920
AB  - (1) Background: Intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) 
      is an established treatment for center-involving diabetic macular edema (ci-DME). 
      However, the clinical response is heterogeneous. This study investigated miRNAs 
      as a biomarker to predict treatment response to anti-VEGF in DME. (2) Methods: 
      Tear fluid, aqueous, and blood were collected from patients with treatment-naïve 
      DME for miRNA expression profiling with quantitative polymerase chain reaction. 
      Differentially expressed miRNAs between good and poor responders were identified 
      from tear fluid. Bioinformatics analysis with the miEAA tool, miRTarBase 
      Annotations, Gene Ontology categories, KEGG, and miRWalk pathways identified 
      interactions between enriched miRNAs and biological pathways. (3) Results: Of 24 
      participants, 28 eyes received bevacizumab (15 eyes) or aflibercept (13 eyes). 
      Tear fluid had the most detectable miRNA species (N = 315), followed by serum (N 
      = 309), then aqueous humor (N = 134). MiRNAs that correlated with change in 
      macular thickness were miR-214-3p, miR-320d, and hsa-miR-874-3p in good 
      responders; and miR-98-5p, miR-196b-5p, and miR-454-3p in poor responders. 
      VEGF-related pathways and the angiogenin-PRI complex were enriched in good 
      responders, while transforming growth factor-β and insulin-like growth factor 
      pathways were enriched in poor responders. (4) Conclusions: We reported a panel 
      of novel miRNAs that provide insight into biological pathways in DME. Validation 
      in larger independent cohorts is needed to determine the predictive performance 
      of these miRNA candidate biomarkers.

AB  - The survival rate in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is low. 
      In addition, metastatic RCC resists traditional treatment. Therefore, 
      identification of novel biomarkers, signaling pathways, and therapeutic targets 
      is an important issue. The aim of the present study is to identify novel 
      prognostic markers from the miRNA-mediated network for the regulation of 
      metastasis of RCC. To address this issue, the RNA of human RCC cell lines, 786-O 
      and ACHN, derived from primary and metastatic sites, respectively, were collected 
      and subjected to RNA sequencing and small RNA sequencing. The bioinformatic 
      analysis revealed that the pathways of the genes with different expressions were 
      related to tumor progression, and identified miRNA and miRNA-long non-coding RNA 
      (lncRNA) interactions, and mRNA. The results revealed that the expressions of 
      seven miRNAs were associated with the overall survival rate of patients with RCC. 
      Furthermore, the expressions of two lncRNA and three protein-coding genes (mRNA) 
      were significantly associated with the increased or decreased disease-free 
      survival rate. Although the detailed regulatory mechanism between miRNAs and 
      targeted genes was not fully understood, our findings present novel prognostic 
      markers and novel insight on miRNA-mediated pathways for metastatic RCC.

AB  - Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in the arterial wall have diverse functions. 
      In pathological states, the interplay between transcripts and microRNAs (miRNAs) 
      leads to phenotypic changes. Understanding the regulatory role of miRNAs and 
      their target genes may reveal how VSMCs modulate the pathogenesis of coronary 
      artery disease. Laser capture microdissection was performed on aortic wall 
      tissues obtained from coronary artery bypass graft patients with and without 
      recent acute myocardial infarction (MI). The mSMRT-qPCR miRNA assay platform 
      (MiRXES, Singapore) was used to profile miRNA. The miRNA data were co-analyzed 
      with significant mRNA transcripts. TargetScan 7.1 was applied to evaluate 
      miRNA-mRNA interactions. The miRNA profiles of 29 patients (16 MI and 13 non-MI) 
      were evaluated. Thirteen VSMC-related miRNAs were differentially expressed 
      between the MI and non-MI groups. Analysis revealed seven miRNA-targeted mRNAs 
      related to muscular tissue differentiation and proliferation. TargetScan revealed 
      that among the VSMC-related transcripts, MBNL1 had a recognition site that 
      matched the hsa-miR-30b-5p target seed sequence. In addition to predicted 
      analysis, our experiment in vitro with human VSMC culture confirmed that 
      hsa-miR-30b-5p negatively correlated with MBNL1. Our data showed that 
      overexpression of hsa-miR-30b-5p led to downregulation of MBNL1 in VSMCs. This 
      process influences VSMC proliferation and might be involved in VSMC 
      differentiation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Identification of cancer subtypes is of great importance to 
      facilitate cancer diagnosis and therapy. A number of methods have been proposed 
      to integrate multi-sources data to identify cancer subtypes in recent years. 
      However, few of them consider the regulatory associations between genome features 
      and the contribution weights of different data-views in data integration. It is 
      widely accepted that the regulatory associations between features play important 
      roles in cancer subtype studies. In addition, different data-views may have 
      different contributions in data integration for cancer subtype prediction. 
      RESULTS: In this paper, we propose a method, CSPRV, to improve the cancer subtype 
      prediction by incorporating multi-sources transcriptome expression data and 
      heterogeneous biological networks. We extract multiple expression features of 
      each genome element based on the regulatory associations in the heterogeneous 
      biological networks and use a generalized matrix correlation method (RV(2)) to 
      predict the similarities between samples in each view of expression data. We fuse 
      the similarity information in multiple data-views according to different 
      integration weights. Based on the integrated similarities between samples, we 
      cluster samples into different subtype groups. Comprehensive experiments on TCGA 
      cancer datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can identify more clinically 
      meaningful cancer subtypes comparing with most existing methods. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      consideration of regulatory associations between biological features and 
      data-views contribution is important to improve the understanding of cancer 
      subtypes. The proposed method provides an open framework to incorporate 
      transcriptome expression data and biological regulation network to predict cancer 
      subtypes.

AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an important class of small noncoding RNA molecules that 
      serve as excellent biomarkers of various diseases. However, current miRNA 
      biomarkers, including those comprised of multiple miRNAs, work at a single-miRNA 
      level but not at a miRNA-set level, which is defined as a group of miRNAs sharing 
      common biological characteristics. Given the rapidly accumulating miRNA omics 
      data, we believe that the miRNA-set level analysis could be an important 
      supplement to the single-miRNA level analysis. Therefore, we present sTAM 
      (http://mir.rnanut.net/stam), a computational tool for single-sample miRNA-set 
      enrichment analysis. Moreover, we demonstrate the utility of sTAM scores in 
      discovering miRNA-set level biomarkers through two case studies. We conduct a 
      pan-cancer analysis of the sTAM scores of the "tumor suppressor miRNA set" on 15 
      types of cancers from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and 14 from Gene Expression 
      Omnibus (GEO), results of which indicated a good performance in distinguishing 
      cancers from controls. Moreover, we reveal that the sTAM scores of the "brain 
      development miRNA set" can effectively predict cerebrovascular disorder (CVD). 
      Finally, we believe that sTAM can be used to discover disease-related biomarkers 
      at a miRNA-set level.

TI  - miRFA: an automated pipeline for microRNA functional analysis with correlation 
      support from TCGA and TCPA expression data in pancreatic cancer.
PG  - 393

AB  - BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNAs that regulate gene expression at a 
      post-transcriptional level and are emerging as potentially important biomarkers 
      for various disease states, including pancreatic cancer. In silico-based 
      functional analysis of miRNAs usually consists of miRNA target prediction and 
      functional enrichment analysis of miRNA targets. Since miRNA target prediction 
      methods generate a large number of false positive target genes, further 
      validation to narrow down interesting candidate miRNA targets is needed. One 
      commonly used method correlates miRNA and mRNA expression to assess the 
      regulatory effect of a particular miRNA. The aim of this study was to build a 
      bioinformatics pipeline in R for miRNA functional analysis including correlation 
      analyses between miRNA expression levels and its targets on mRNA and protein 
      expression levels available from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) and the cancer 
      proteome atlas (TCPA). TCGA-derived expression data of specific mature miRNA 
      isoforms from pancreatic cancer tissue was used. RESULTS: Fifteen circulating 
      miRNAs with significantly altered expression levels detected in pancreatic cancer 
      patients were queried separately in the pipeline. The pipeline generated 
      predicted miRNA target genes, enriched gene ontology (GO) terms and Kyoto 
      encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathways. Predicted miRNA targets were 
      evaluated by correlation analyses between each miRNA and its predicted targets. 
      MiRNA functional analysis in combination with Kaplan-Meier survival analysis 
      suggest that hsa-miR-885-5p could act as a tumor suppressor and should be 
      validated as a potential prognostic biomarker in pancreatic cancer. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Our miRNA functional analysis (miRFA) pipeline can serve as a valuable tool in 
      biomarker discovery involving mature miRNAs associated with pancreatic cancer and 
      could be developed to cover additional cancer types. Results for all mature 
      miRNAs in TCGA pancreatic adenocarcinoma dataset can be studied and downloaded 
      through a shiny web application at https://emmbor.shinyapps.io/mirfa/ .

AB  - Small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs), including microRNAs (miRNAs) are important 
      post-transcriptional gene expression regulators relevant in physiological and 
      pathological processes. Here, we combined a high-throughput functional screening 
      (HTFS) platform with a library of antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) to 
      systematically identify sncRNAs that affect neuronal cell survival in basal 
      conditions and in response to oxidative stress (OS), a major hallmark in 
      neurodegenerative diseases. We considered hits commonly detected by two 
      statistical methods in three biological replicates. Forty-seven ASOs targeting 
      miRNAs (miRNA-ASOs) consistently decreased cell viability under basal conditions. 
      A total of 60 miRNA-ASOs worsened cell viability impairment mediated by OS, with 
      36.6% commonly affecting cell viability under basal conditions. In addition, 40 
      miRNA-ASOs significantly protected neuronal cells from OS. In agreement with cell 
      viability impairment, damaging miRNA-ASOs specifically induced increased free 
      radical biogenesis. miRNAs targeted by the detrimental ASOs are enriched in the 
      fraction of miRNAs downregulated by OS, suggesting that the miRNA expression 
      pattern after OS contributes to neuronal damage. The present HTFS highlighted 
      potentially druggable sncRNAs. However, future studies are needed to define the 
      pathways by which the identified ASOs regulate cell survival and OS response and 
      to explore the potential of translating the current findings into clinical 
      applications.

TI  - A prototypical non-malignant epithelial model to study genome dynamics and 
      concurrently monitor micro-RNAs and proteins in situ during oncogene-induced 
      senescence.
PG  - 37
LID - 10.1186/s12864-017-4375-1 [doi]
LID - 37
AB  - BACKGROUND: Senescence is a fundamental biological process implicated in various 
      pathologies, including cancer. Regarding carcinogenesis, senescence signifies, at 
      least in its initial phases, an anti-tumor response that needs to be circumvented 
      for cancer to progress. Micro-RNAs, a subclass of regulatory, non-coding RNAs, 
      participate in senescence regulation. At the subcellular level micro-RNAs, 
      similar to proteins, have been shown to traffic between organelles influencing 
      cellular behavior. The differential function of micro-RNAs relative to their 
      subcellular localization and their role in senescence biology raises concurrent 
      in situ analysis of coding and non-coding gene products in senescent cells as a 
      necessity. However, technical challenges have rendered in situ co-detection 
      unfeasible until now. METHODS: In the present report we describe a methodology 
      that bypasses these technical limitations achieving for the first time 
      simultaneous detection of both a micro-RNA and a protein in the biological 
      context of cellular senescence, utilizing the new commercially available 
      SenTraGor(TM) compound. The method was applied in a prototypical human 
      non-malignant epithelial model of oncogene-induced senescence that we generated 
      for the purposes of the study. For the characterization of this novel system, we 
      applied a wide range of cellular and molecular techniques, as well as 
      high-throughput analysis of the transcriptome and micro-RNAs. RESULTS: This 
      experimental setting has three advantages that are presented and discussed: i) it 
      covers a "gap" in the molecular carcinogenesis field, as almost all corresponding 
      in vitro models are fibroblast-based, even though the majority of neoplasms have 
      epithelial origin, ii) it recapitulates the precancerous and cancerous phases of 
      epithelial tumorigenesis within a short time frame under the light of natural 
      selection and iii) it uses as an oncogenic signal, the replication licensing 
      factor CDC6, implicated in both DNA replication and transcription when 
      over-expressed, a characteristic that can be exploited to monitor RNA dynamics. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Consequently, we demonstrate that our model is optimal for studying 
      the molecular basis of epithelial carcinogenesis shedding light on the 
      tumor-initiating events. The latter may reveal novel molecular targets with 
      clinical benefit. Besides, since this method can be incorporated in a wide range 
      of low, medium or high-throughput image-based approaches, we expect it to be 
      broadly applicable.

AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are class of small RNA molecules with major impact on gene 
      regulation. We analyzed the potential of miRNAs secreted from pre-implantation 
      embryos into the embryonic culture media as biomarkers to predict successful 
      pregnancy. Using microarray analysis, we profiled the miRNome of the 56 spent 
      culture media (SCM) after embryos transfer and found a total of 621 miRNAs in the 
      SCM. On average, we detected 163 miRNAs in SCM of samples with failed 
      pregnancies, but only 149 SCM miRNAs of embryos leading to pregnancies. MiR-634 
      predicted an embryo transfer leading to a positive pregnancy with an accuracy of 
      71% and a sensitivity of 85%. Among the 621 miRNAs, 102 (16.4%) showed a 
      differential expression between positive and negative outcome of pregnancy with 
      miR-29c-3p as the most significantly differentially expressed miRNA. The number 
      of extracellular vehicles was lower in SCM with positive outcomes (3.8 × 10(9)/mL 
      EVs), as compared to a negative outcome (7.35 × 10(9)/mL EVs) possibly explaining 
      the reduced number of miRNAs in the SCM associated with failed pregnancies. The 
      analysis of the miRNome in the SCM of couples undergoing fertility treatment lays 
      the ground towards development of biomarkers to predict successful pregnancy and 
      towards understanding the role of embryonic miRNAs found in the SCM.

AB  - MicroRNAs are small ribonucleic acid that act as an important regulator of gene 
      expression at the molecular level. However, there is no comparative data on the 
      regulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) in visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and 
      post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL). In this current study, we compared 
      the expression miRNA profile in host cells (G(THP)), with VL strain (G(VL)) and 
      PKDL strain-infected host cell (G(PKDL)). Normalized read count comparison 
      between different conditions revealed that the miRNAs are indeed differentially 
      expressed. In G(PKDL) with respect to G(VL) and G(THP), a total of 798 and 879 
      miRNAs were identified, out of which 349 and 518 are known miRNAs, respectively. 
      Comparative analysis of changes in miRNA expression suggested that the 
      involvement of differentially expressed miRNAs in various biological processes 
      like PI3K pathway activation, cell cycle regulation, immunomodulation, apoptosis 
      inhibition, different cytokine production, T-cell phenotypic transitions calcium 
      regulation, and so on. A pathway enrichment study using in silico predicted gene 
      targets of differentially expressed miRNAs showed evidence of potentially 
      universal immune signaling pathway effects. Whereas cytokine-cytokine receptor 
      interaction, phagocytosis, and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) signaling 
      pathways were more highly enriched using targets of miRNAs upregulated in 
      G(PKDL). These findings could contribute to a better understanding of PKDL 
      pathogenesis. Furthermore, the identified miRNAs could also be used as biomarkers 
      in diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutics of PKDL infection control.

TI  - The microRNA target site landscape is a novel molecular feature associating 
      alternative polyadenylation with immune evasion activity in breast cancer.
LID - 10.1093/bib/bbaa191 [doi]
LID - bbaa191
AB  - Alternative polyadenylation (APA) in breast tumor samples results in the 
      removal/addition of cis-regulatory elements such as microRNA (miRNA) target sites 
      in the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTRs) of genes. Although previous computational 
      APA studies focused on a subset of genes strongly affected by APA (APA genes), we 
      identify miRNAs of which widespread APA events collectively increase or decrease 
      the number of target sites [probabilistic inference of microRNA target site 
      modification through APA (PRIMATA-APA)]. Using PRIMATA-APA on the cancer genome 
      atlas (TCGA) breast cancer data, we found that the global APA events change the 
      number of the target sites of particular microRNAs [target sites modified miRNA 
      (tamoMiRNA)] enriched for cancer development and treatments. We also found that 
      when knockdown (KD) of NUDT21 in HeLa cells induces a different set of widespread 
      3'-UTR shortening than TCGA breast cancer data, it changes the target sites of 
      the common tamoMiRNAs. Since the NUDT21 KD experiment previously demonstrated the 
      tumorigenic role of APA events in a miRNA dependent fashion, this result suggests 
      that the APA-initiated tumorigenesis is attributable to the miRNA target site 
      changes, not the APA events themselves. Further, we found that the miRNA target 
      site changes identify tumor cell proliferation and immune cell infiltration to 
      the tumor microenvironment better than the miRNA expression levels or the APA 
      events themselves. Altogether, our computational analyses provide a 
      proof-of-concept demonstration that the miRNA target site information indicates 
      the effect of global APA events with a potential as predictive biomarker.
