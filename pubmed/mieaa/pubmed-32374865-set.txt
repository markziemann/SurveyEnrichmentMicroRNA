TI  - miEAA 2.0: integrating multi-species microRNA enrichment analysis and workflow 
      management systems.
PG  - W521-W528
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkaa309 [doi]
AB  - Gene set enrichment analysis has become one of the most frequently used 
      applications in molecular biology research. Originally developed for gene sets, 
      the same statistical principles are now available for all omics types. In 2016, 
      we published the miRNA enrichment analysis and annotation tool (miEAA) for human 
      precursor and mature miRNAs. Here, we present miEAA 2.0, supporting miRNA input 
      from ten frequently investigated organisms. To facilitate inclusion of miEAA in 
      workflow systems, we implemented an Application Programming Interface (API). 
      Users can perform miRNA set enrichment analysis using either the web-interface, a 
      dedicated Python package, or custom remote clients. Moreover, the number of 
      category sets was raised by an order of magnitude. We implemented novel 
      categories like annotation confidence level or localisation in biological 
      compartments. In combination with the miRBase miRNA-version and 
      miRNA-to-precursor converters, miEAA supports research settings where older 
      releases of miRBase are in use. The web server also offers novel comprehensive 
      visualizations such as heatmaps and running sum curves with background 
      distributions. We demonstrate the new features with case studies for human kidney 
      cancer, a biomarker study on Parkinson's disease from the PPMI cohort, and a 
      mouse model for breast cancer. The tool is freely accessible at: 
      https://www.ccb.uni-saarland.de/mieaa2.

TI  - Potential of miRNAs in Plasma Extracellular Vesicle for the Stratification of 
      Prostate Cancer in a South African Population.
LID - 10.3390/cancers15153968 [doi]
LID - 3968
AB  - Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common cause of cancer death among African men. 
      The analysis of microRNAs (miRNAs) in plasma extracellular vesicles (EVs) can be 
      utilized as a non-invasive tool for the diagnosis of PCa. In this study, we used 
      small RNA sequencing to profile miRNAs cargo in plasma EVs from South African PCa 
      patients. We evaluated the differential expression of miRNAs between low and high 
      Gleason scores in the plasma EVs of South African patients and in the prostatic 
      tissue from data available in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Data Portal. We 
      identified 7 miRNAs differently expressed in both EVs and prostatic tissues. We 
      evaluated their expression using qPCR in a larger cohort of 10 patients with 
      benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and 24 patients with PCa. Here, we reported 
      that the ratio between two of these miRNAs (i.e., miR-194-5p/miR-16-5p) showed a 
      higher concentration in PCa compared to BPH and in metastatic PCa compared to 
      localized PCa. We explored for the first time the profiling of miRNAs cargo in 
      plasma EVs as a tool for the identification of putative markers in the South 
      African population. Our finding indicated the ratio miR-194-5p/miR-16-5p as a 
      non-invasive marker for the evaluation of PCa aggressiveness in this population.

AB  - Previous work on murine models and humans demonstrated global as well as 
      tissue-specific molecular ageing trajectories of RNAs. Extracellular vesicles 
      (EVs) are membrane vesicles mediating the horizontal transfer of genetic 
      information between different tissues. We sequenced small regulatory RNAs 
      (sncRNAs) in two mouse plasma fractions at five time points across the lifespan 
      from 2-18 months: (1) sncRNAs that are free-circulating (fc-RNA) and (2) sncRNAs 
      bound outside or inside EVs (EV-RNA). Different sncRNA classes exhibit unique 
      ageing patterns that vary between the fcRNA and EV-RNA fractions. While tRNAs 
      showed the highest correlation with ageing in both fractions, rRNAs exhibited 
      inverse correlation trajectories between the EV- and fc-fractions. For miRNAs, 
      the EV-RNA fraction was exceptionally strongly associated with ageing, especially 
      the miR-29 family in adipose tissues. Sequencing of sncRNAs and coding genes in 
      fat tissue of an independent cohort of aged mice up to 27 months highlighted the 
      pivotal role of miR-29a-3p and miR-29b-3p in ageing-related gene regulation that 
      we validated in a third cohort by RT-qPCR.

      metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.

LID - 259
AB  - BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) of plasma-derived small extracellular vesicles 
      (sEVs) have been proven to be associated with metastasis in several types of 
      cancer. This study aimed to detect miRNAs of plasma-derived sEVs as potential 
      biomarkers for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: We 
      assessed the miRNA profiles of plasma-derived sEVs from healthy individuals as 
      the control group (CT group), NSCLC patients without distant organ metastasis as 
      the NM-NSCLC group and patients with distant organ metastasis as the M-NSCLC 
      group. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) was performed on samples, and 
      differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) of the three groups were screened. Kyoto 
      Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and ClueGO were used to predict 
      potential pathways of DEMs. MiRNA enrichment analysis and annotation tool (miEAA) 
      was used to understand changes in the tumour microenvironment in NSCLC. 
      Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT‒PCR) analysis 
      was used to validate target miRNAs. RESULT: NGS was performed on 38 samples of 
      miRNAs of plasma-derived sEVs, and DEMs were screened out between the above three 
      groups. Regarding the distribution of DEMs in the NM-NSCLC and M-NSCLC groups, 
      KEGG pathway analysis showed enrichment in focal adhesion and gap junctions and 
      ClueGO in the Rap1 and Hippo signaling pathways; miEAA found that fibroblasts 
      were over-represented. From our screening, miRNA-200c-3p and miRNA-4429 were 
      found to be predictive DEMs among the CT, NM-NSCLC and M-NSCLC groups, and 
      qRT‒PCR was applied to verify the results. Finally, it was revealed that 
      expression levels of miR-200c-3p and miR-4429 were significantly upregulated in 
      M-NSCLC patients. CONCLUSION: This study identified miRNA-200c-3p and miRNA-4429 
      as potential biomarkers for NSCLC metastasis.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, can 
      infect almost any nucleated cell in the mammalian host. Although previous studies 
      have described the transcriptomic changes that occur in host cells during 
      parasite infection, the understanding of the role of post-transcriptional 
      regulation in this process is limited. MicroRNAs, a class of short non-coding 
      RNAs, are key players in regulating gene expression at the post-transcriptional 
      level, and their involvement in the host-T. cruzi interplay is a growing area of 
      research. However, to our knowledge, there are no comparative studies on the 
      microRNA changes that occur in different cell types in response to T. cruzi 
      infection. METHODS AND RESULTS: Here we investigated microRNA changes in 
      epithelial cells, cardiomyocytes and macrophages infected with T. cruzi for 24 
      hours, using small RNA sequencing followed by careful bioinformatics analysis. We 
      show that, although microRNAs are highly cell type-specific, a signature of three 
      microRNAs -miR-146a, miR-708 and miR-1246, emerges as consistently responsive to 
      T. cruzi infection across representative human cell types. T. cruzi lacks 
      canonical microRNA-induced silencing mechanisms and we confirm that it does not 
      produce any small RNA that mimics known host microRNAs. We found that macrophages 
      show a broad response to parasite infection, while microRNA changes in epithelial 
      and cardiomyocytes are modest. Complementary data indicated that cardiomyocyte 
      response may be greater at early time points of infection. CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      findings emphasize the significance of considering microRNA changes at the 
      cellular level and complement previous studies conducted at higher organizational 
      levels, such as heart samples. While miR-146a has been previously implicated in 
      T. cruzi infection, similarly to its involvement in many other immunological 
      responses, miR-1246 and miR-708 are demonstrated here for the first time. Given 
      their expression in multiple cell types, we anticipate our work as a starting 
      point for future investigations into their role in the post-transcriptional 
      regulation of T. cruzi infected cells and their potential as biomarkers for 
      Chagas disease.

AB  - MOTIVATION: With the rapid advances of RNA sequencing and microarray technologies 
      in non-coding RNA (ncRNA) research, functional tools that perform enrichment 
      analysis for ncRNAs are needed. On the one hand, because of the rapidly growing 
      interest in circRNAs, snoRNAs, and piRNAs, it is essential to develop tools for 
      enrichment analysis for these newly emerged ncRNAs. On the other hand, due to the 
      key role of ncRNAs' interacting target in the determination of their function, 
      the interactions between ncRNA and its corresponding target should be fully 
      considered in functional enrichment. Based on the ncRNA-mRNA/protein-function 
      strategy, some tools have been developed to functionally analyze a single type of 
      ncRNA (the majority focuses on miRNA); in addition, some tools adopt predicted 
      target data and lead to only low-confidence results. RESULTS: Herein, an online 
      tool named RNAenrich was developed to enable the comprehensive and accurate 
      enrichment analysis of ncRNAs. It is unique in (i) realizing the enrichment 
      analysis for various RNA types in humans and mice, such as miRNA, lncRNA, 
      circRNA, snoRNA, piRNA, and mRNA; (ii) extending the analysis by introducing 
      millions of experimentally validated data of RNA-target interactions as a 
      built-in database; and (iii) providing a comprehensive interacting network among 
      various ncRNAs and targets to facilitate the mechanistic study of ncRNA function. 
      Importantly, RNAenrich led to a more comprehensive and accurate enrichment 
      analysis in a COVID-19-related miRNA case, which was largely attributed to its 
      coverage of comprehensive ncRNA-target interactions. AVAILABILITY AND 
      IMPLEMENTATION: RNAenrich is now freely accessible at 
      https://idrblab.org/rnaenr/.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In this study, we conducted an integrated study of the diagnostic 
      value of MiR-223 in ectopic pregnancy (EP). METHODS: We used GSE44731 downloaded 
      from GEO and GEO2R to identify differentially expressed miRNA. The hub genes 
      corresponding to the differential miRNA were then identified by using the Xiantao 
      academic tool, GO (Gene Ontology), and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and 
      Genomes). Afterward, we used the miEAA database to perform gene set enrichment 
      analysis (GSEA) of differential miRNA, and used Xiantao academic tools again to 
      conduct the ceRNA network based on the target genes. Protein-protein interaction 
      (PPI) network construction and lncRNA of hub miRNA target genes were then 
      predicted by the starbase database. For validation, the villus tissue from 
      intrauterine pregnancy and tubal pregnancy was collected and assayed by qPCR. 
      RESULTS: In total 19 differentially expressed miRNAs were screened out, of which 
      MiR-223 had a relatively clear diagnostic significance. Hub genes were enriched 
      and analyzed by GO, KEGG, and GSEA, and the results showed that regulation of 
      NF-κB and other signaling pathways are primarily enriched in ectopic pregnancy. 
      We also obtained 215 key genes from PPI analysis. Our ceRNA analysis indicated 
      that LRRC75A-AS1 and PITPNA-AS1 were associated with MiR-223, and the expression 
      of MiR-223 in qPCR was significantly high in tubal pregnancy group. CONCLUSION: 
      We found that MiR-223 can be used in the diagnosis of EP. Our findings provide 
      valuable information and direction for future research into novel targets for EP 
      diagnosis.

AB  - Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has a high fatality rate, mainly due to 
      its asymptomatic nature until late-stage disease and therefore delayed diagnosis 
      that leads to a lack of timely treatment intervention. Consequently, there is a 
      significant need for better methods to screen populations that are at high risk 
      of developing PDAC. Such advances would result in earlier diagnosis, more 
      treatment options, and ultimately better outcomes for patients. Several recent 
      studies have applied the concept of liquid biopsy, which is the sampling of a 
      biofluid (such as blood plasma) for the presence of disease biomarkers, to 
      develop screening approaches for PDAC; several of these studies have focused on 
      analysis of extracellular vesicles (EVs) and their cargoes. While these studies 
      have identified many potential biomarkers for PDAC that are present within EVs, 
      their application to clinical practice is hindered by the lack of a robust, 
      reproducible method for EV isolation and analysis that is amenable to a clinical 
      setting. Our previous research has shown that the Vn96 synthetic peptide is 
      indeed a robust and reproducible method for EV isolation that has the potential 
      to be used in a clinical setting. We have therefore chosen to investigate the 
      utility of the Vn96 synthetic peptide for this isolation of EVs from human plasma 
      and the subsequent detection of small RNA biomarkers of PDAC by Next-generation 
      sequencing (NGS) analysis. We find that analysis of small RNA from Vn96-isolated 
      EVs permits the discrimination of PDAC patients from non-affected individuals. 
      Moreover, analyses of all small RNA species, miRNAs, and lncRNA fragments are 
      most effective at segregating PDAC patients from non-affected individuals. 
      Several of the identified small RNA biomarkers have been previously associated 
      with and/or characterized in PDAC, indicating the validity of our findings, 
      whereas other identified small RNA biomarkers may have novel roles in PDAC or 
      cancer in general. Overall, our results provide a basis for a 
      clinically-amendable detection and/or screening strategy for PDAC using a liquid 
      biopsy approach that relies on Vn96-mediated isolation of EVs from plasma.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Patients treated with radiotherapy to the chest region are at risk 
      of cardiac sequelae, however, identification of those with greatest risk of 
      complications remains difficult. Here, we sought to determine whether short-term 
      changes in circulating miRNA expression are related to measures of cardiac 
      dysfunction in follow-up. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two parallel patient cohorts 
      were enrolled and followed up for 3 years after completion of RT to treat 
      left-sided breast cancer. In the primary group (N=28) we used a a panel of 752 
      miRNAs to identify miRNAs associated with radiation and cardiac indices at follow 
      up. In the second, independent cohort (N=56) we validated those candidate miRNAs 
      with a targeted qPCR panel. In both cohorts. serum samples were collected before 
      RT, 24h after the last dose and 1 month after RT; cardiac echocardiography was 
      performed 2.5-3 year after RT. RESULTS: Seven miRNAs in the primary group showed 
      marked changes in serum miRNAs immediately after RT compared to baseline and 
      associations with cardiopulmonary dose-volume histogram metrics. Among those 
      miRNAs: miR-15b-5p, miR-22-3p, miR-424-5p and miR-451a were confirmed to show 
      significant decrease of expression 24 hours post-RT in the validation cohort. 
      Moreover, miR-29c, miR-451 and miR-424 were correlated with the end-diastolic 
      diameter of the left ventricle, which was also confirmed in multivariable 
      analysis adjusting for RT-associated factors. CONCLUSION: We identified a subset 
      of circulating miRNAs predictive for cardiac function impairment in patients 
      treated for left-sided breast cancer, although longer clinical observation could 
      determine if these can be used to predict major clinical endpoints.

      and tissue contexts.
PG  - W154-W159
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkad431 [doi]
AB  - DIANA-miRPath is an online miRNA analysis platform harnessing predicted or 
      experimentally supported miRNA interactions towards the exploration of combined 
      miRNA effects. In its latest version (v4.0, http://www.microrna.gr/miRPathv4), 
      DIANA-miRPath breaks new ground by introducing the capacity to tailor its 
      target-based miRNA functional analysis engine to specific biological and/or 
      experimental contexts. Via a redesigned modular interface with rich interaction, 
      annotation and parameterization options, users can now perform enrichment 
      analysis on Gene Ontology (GO) terms, KEGG and REACTOME pathways, sets from 
      Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) and PFAM. Included miRNA interaction sets 
      are derived from state-of-the-art resources of experimentally supported 
      (DIANA-TarBase v8.0, miRTarBase and microCLIP cell-type-specific interactions) or 
      from in silico miRNA-target interactions (updated DIANA-microT-CDS and TargetScan 
      predictions). Bulk and single-cell expression datasets from The Cancer Genome 
      Atlas (TCGA), the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx) and adult/fetal 
      single-cell atlases are integrated and can be used to assess the expression of 
      enriched term components across a wide range of states. A discrete module 
      enabling enrichment analyses using CRISPR knock-out screen datasets enables the 
      detection of selected miRNAs with potentially crucial roles within conditions 
      under study. Notably, the option to upload custom interaction, term, 
      expression and screen sets further expands the versatility of miRPath webserver.

AB  - Kidney disease is prevalent in diabetes. Urinary exosomes (uE) from animal models 
      and patients with Diabetic nephropathy (DN) showed increased levels of miRs with 
      reno-protective potential. We examined whether urinary loss of such miRs is 
      associated with their reduced renal levels in DN patients. We also tested whether 
      injecting uE can leverage kidney disease in rats. In this study (study-1) we 
      performed microarray profiling of miRNA in uE and renal tissues in DN patients 
      and subjects with diabetes without DN (controls). In study-2, diabetes was 
      induced in Wistar rats by Streptozotocin (i.p. 50 mg/kg of body weight). Urinary 
      exosomes were collected at 6th, 7th and 8th weeks, and injected back into the 
      rats (100ug/biweekly, uE-treated n=7) via tail vein on weeks 9 and 10. Equal 
      volume of vehicle was injected in controls (vehicle, n=7). uE from the human and 
      rat showed the presence of exosome-specific proteins by immunoblotting. 
      Microarray profiling revealed a set of 15 miRs having high levels in the uE, 
      while lower in renal biopsies, from DN, compared to controls (n=5-9/group). 
      Bioinformatic analysis also confirmed the Renoprotective potential of these miRs. 
      Taqman qPCR confirmed the opposite regulation of miR-200c-3p and miR-24-3p in 
      paired uE and renal biopsy samples from DN patients (n=15), relative to non-DN 
      controls. A rise in 28 miRs levels, including miR-200c-3p, miR-24-3p, miR-30a-3p 
      and miR-23a-3p were observed in the uE of DN rats, collected between 6th-8th 
      weeks, relative to baseline (before diabetes induction). uE- treated DN rats had 
      significantly reduced urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio, attenuated renal 
      pathology, and lower miR-24-3p target fibrotic/inflammatory genes (TGF-beta, and 
      Collagen IV), relative to vehicle treated DN rats. In uE treated rats, the renal 
      expression of miR-24-3p, miR-30a-3p, let-7a-5p and miR-23a-3p was increased, 
      relative to vehicle control. Patients with diabetic nephropathy had reduced renal 
      levels, while higher uE abundance of miRs with reno-protective potential. 
      Reverting the urinary loss of miRs by injecting uE attenuated renal pathology in 
      diabetic rats.

AB  - Although extensive research has been carried out on the epigenetic regulation of 
      single RNA modifications in gastric cancer, little is known regarding the 
      crosstalk of four major RNA adenosine modifications, namely, m6A, m1A, 
      alternative polyadenylation and adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing. By analyzing 26 
      RNA modification "writers" in 1750 gastric cancer samples, we creatively 
      constructed a scoring model called the "Writers" of the RNA Modification Score 
      (WRM_Score), which was able to quantify the RNA modification subtypes of 
      individual patients. In addition, we explored the relationship between WRM_Score 
      and transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation, tumor microenvironment, 
      clinical features and molecular subtypes. We constructed an RNA modification 
      scoring model including two different subgroups: WRM_Score_low and 
      WRM_Score_high. The former was associated with survival benefit and good efficacy 
      of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) due to gene repair and immune activation, 
      while the latter was related to poor prognosis and bad efficacy of ICIs because 
      of stromal activation and immunosuppression. The WRM score based on immune and 
      molecular characteristics of the RNA modification pattern is a reliable predictor 
      of the prognosis of gastric cancer and the therapeutic efficacy of immune 
      checkpoint inhibitors in gastric cancer.

AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that play a critical role in 
      regulating diverse biological processes. Extracting functional insights from a 
      list of miRNAs is challenging, as each miRNA can potentially interact with 
      hundreds of genes. To address this challenge, we developed miEAA, a flexible and 
      comprehensive miRNA enrichment analysis tool based on direct and indirect miRNA 
      annotation. The latest release of miEAA includes a data warehouse of 19 miRNA 
      repositories, covering 10 different organisms and 139 399 functional categories. 
      We have added information on the cellular context of miRNAs, isomiRs, and 
      high-confidence miRNAs to improve the accuracy of the results. We have also 
      improved the representation of aggregated results, including interactive Upset 
      plots to aid users in understanding the interaction among enriched terms or 
      categories. Finally, we demonstrate the functionality of miEAA in the context of 
      ageing and highlight the importance of carefully considering the miRNA input 
      list. MiEAA is free to use and publicly available at 
      https://www.ccb.uni-saarland.de/mieaa/.

TI  - Intrauterine Smoke Exposure, microRNA Expression during Human Lung Development, 
      and Childhood Asthma.
LID - 10.3390/ijms24097727 [doi]
LID - 7727
AB  - Intrauterine smoke (IUS) exposure during early childhood has been associated with 
      a number of negative health consequences, including reduced lung function and 
      asthma susceptibility. The biological mechanisms underlying these associations 
      have not been established. MicroRNAs regulate the expression of numerous genes 
      involved in lung development. Thus, investigation of the impact of IUS on miRNA 
      expression during human lung development may elucidate the impact of IUS on 
      post-natal respiratory outcomes. We sought to investigate the effect of IUS 
      exposure on miRNA expression during early lung development. We hypothesized that 
      miRNA-mRNA networks are dysregulated by IUS during human lung development and 
      that these miRNAs may be associated with future risk of asthma and allergy. Human 
      fetal lung samples from a prenatal tissue retrieval program were tested for 
      differential miRNA expression with IUS exposure (measured using placental 
      cotinine concentration). RNA was extracted and miRNA-sequencing was performed. We 
      performed differential expression using IUS exposure, with covariate adjustment. 
      We also considered the above model with an additional sex-by-IUS interaction 
      term, allowing IUS effects to differ by male and female samples. Using paired 
      gene expression profiles, we created sex-stratified miRNA-mRNA correlation 
      networks predictive of IUS using DIABLO. We additionally evaluated whether miRNAs 
      were associated with asthma and allergy outcomes in a cohort of childhood asthma. 
      We profiled pseudoglandular lung miRNA in n = 298 samples, 139 (47%) of which had 
      evidence of IUS exposure. Of 515 miRNAs, 25 were significantly associated with 
      intrauterine smoke exposure (q-value < 0.10). The IUS associated miRNAs were 
      correlated with well-known asthma genes (e.g., ORM1-Like Protein 3, ORDML3) and 
      enriched in disease-relevant pathways (oxidative stress). Eleven IUS-miRNAs were 
      also correlated with clinical measures (e.g., Immunoglobulin E andlungfunction) 
      in children with asthma, further supporting their likely disease relevance. 
      Lastly, we found substantial differences in IUS effects by sex, finding 95 
      significant IUS-miRNAs in male samples, but only four miRNAs in female samples. 
      The miRNA-mRNA correlation networks were predictive of IUS (AUC = 0.78 in males 
      and 0.86 in females) and suggested that IUS-miRNAs are involved in regulation of 
      disease-relevant genes (e.g., A disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain 19 
      (ADAM19), LBH regulator of WNT signaling (LBH)) and sex hormone signaling 
      (Coactivator associated methyltransferase 1(CARM1)). Our study demonstrated 
      differential expression of miRNAs by IUS during early prenatal human lung 
      development, which may be modified by sex. Based on their gene targets and 
      correlation to clinical asthma and atopy outcomes, these IUS-miRNAs may be 
      relevant for subsequent allergy and asthma risk. Our study provides insight into 
      the impact of IUS in human fetal lung transcriptional networks and on the 
      developmental origins of asthma and allergic disorders.

TI  - Circulating cardiac MicroRNAs safeguard against dilated cardiomyopathy.
PG  - e1258
LID - 10.1002/ctm2.1258 [doi]
LID - e1258
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiac-resident or -enriched microRNAs (miRNAs) could be released 
      into the bloodstream becoming circulating cardiac miRNAs, which are increasingly 
      recognized as non-invasive and accessible biomarkers of multiple heart diseases. 
      However, dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)-associated circulating miRNAs (DACMs) and 
      their roles in DCM pathogenesis remain largely unexplored. METHODS: Two human 
      cohorts, consisting of healthy individuals and DCM patients, were enrolled for 
      serum miRNA sequencing (10 vs. 10) and quantitative polymerase chain reaction 
      validation (46 vs. 54), respectively. Rigorous screening strategy was enacted to 
      define DACMs and their potentials for diagnosis. DCM mouse model, different 
      sources of cardiomyocytes, adeno-associated virus 9 (AAV9), gene knockout, 
      RNAscope miRNA in situ hybridization, mRFP-GFP-LC3B reporter, echocardiography 
      and transmission electron microscopy were adopted for mechanistic explorations. 
      RESULTS: Serum miRNA sequencing revealed a unique expression pattern for DCM 
      circulating miRNAs. DACMs miR-26a-5p, miR-30c-5p, miR-126-5p and miR-126-3p were 
      found to be depleted in DCM circulation as well as heart tissues. Their 
      expressions in circulation and heart tissues were proven to be correlated 
      significantly, and a combination of these miRNAs was suggested potential values 
      for DCM diagnosis. FOXO3, a predicted common target, was experimentally 
      demonstrated to be co-repressed within cardiomyocytes by these DACMs except 
      miR-26a-5p. Delivery of a combination of miR-30c-5p, miR-126-5p and miR-126-3p 
      into the murine myocardium via AAV9 carrying an expression cassette driven by 
      cTnT promoter, or cardiac-specific knockout of FOXO3 (Myh6-Cre(ERT2) , FOXO3 
      flox(+/+) ) dramatically attenuated cardiac apoptosis and autophagy involved in 
      DCM progression. Moreover, competitively disrupting the interplay between DACMs 
      and FOXO3 mRNA by specifically introducing their interacting regions into murine 
      myocardium crippled the cardioprotection of DACMs against DCM. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Circulating cardiac miRNA-FOXO3 axis plays a pivotal role in safeguarding against 
      myocardial apoptosis and excessive autophagy in DCM development, which may 
      provide serological cues for DCM non-invasive diagnosis and shed light on DCM 
      pathogenesis and therapeutic targets.

AB  - Noncoding RNAs have diagnostic and prognostic importance in Parkinson's disease 
      (PD). We studied circulating small noncoding RNAs (sncRNAs) in two large-scale 
      longitudinal PD cohorts (Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) and 
      Luxembourg Parkinson's Study (NCER-PD)) and modeled their impact on the 
      transcriptome. Sequencing of sncRNAs in 5,450 blood samples of 1,614 individuals 
      in PPMI yielded 323 billion reads, most of which mapped to microRNAs but covered 
      also other RNA classes such as piwi-interacting RNAs, ribosomal RNAs and small 
      nucleolar RNAs. Dysregulated microRNAs associated with disease and disease 
      progression occur in two distinct waves in the third and seventh decade of life. 
      Originating predominantly from immune cells, they resemble a systemic 
      inflammation response and mitochondrial dysfunction, two hallmarks of PD. 
      Profiling 1,553 samples from 1,024 individuals in the NCER-PD cohort validated 
      biomarkers and main findings by an independent technology. Finally, network 
      analysis of sncRNA and transcriptome sequencing from PPMI identified regulatory 
      modules emerging in patients with progressing PD.

TI  - Insights on the Biomarker Potential of Exosomal Non-Coding RNAs in Colorectal 
      Cancer: An In Silico Characterization of Related Exosomal 
      lncRNA/circRNA-miRNA-Target Axis.
LID - 10.3390/cells12071081 [doi]
LID - 1081
AB  - Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common cancer types, ranking third 
      after lung and breast cancers. As such, it demands special attention for better 
      characterization, which may eventually result in the development of early 
      detection strategies and preventive measures. Currently, components of bodily 
      fluids, which may reflect various disease states, are being increasingly 
      researched for their biomarker potential. One of these components is the 
      circulating extracellular vesicles, namely, exosomes, which are demonstrated to 
      carry various cargo. Of importance, the non-coding RNA cargo of circulating 
      exosomes, especially long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), circular RNAs (circRNAs), 
      and micro RNAs (miRNAs), may potentially serve as significant diagnostic and 
      prognostic/predictive biomarkers. In this review, we present existing evidence on 
      the diagnostic and prognostic/predictive biomarker value of exosomal non-coding 
      RNAs in CRC. In addition, taking advantage of the miRNA sponging functionality of 
      lncRNAs and circRNAs, we demonstrate an experimentally validated CRC exosomal 
      non-coding RNA-regulated target gene axis benefiting from published miRNA 
      sponging studies in CRC. Hence, we present a set of target genes and pathways 
      downstream of the lncRNA/circRNA-miRNA-target axis along with associated 
      significant Gene Ontology (GO) terms and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes 
      (KEGG) pathways, which may collectively serve to better characterize CRC and shed 
      light on the significance of exosomal non-coding RNAs in CRC diagnosis and 
      prognosis/prediction.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Neuropathic pain (NeP) is a pathological condition arising from a 
      lesion or disease affecting the somatosensory system. Accumulating evidence has 
      shown that circular RNAs (circRNAs) exert critical functions in neurodegenerative 
      diseases by sponging microRNAs (miRNAs). However, the functions and regulatory 
      mechanisms of circRNAs as competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) in NeP remain to 
      be determined. METHODS: The sequencing dataset GSE96051 was obtained from the 
      public Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. First, we conducted a comparison 
      of gene expression profiles in the L3/L4 dorsal root ganglion (DRG) of sciatic 
      nerve transection (SNT) mice (n = 5) and uninjured mice (Control) (n = 4) to 
      define the differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Then, critical hub genes were 
      screened by exploring protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks with Cytoscape 
      software, and the miRNAs bound to them were predicted and selected and then 
      validated by qRT-PCR. Furthermore, key circRNAs were predicted and filtered, and 
      the network of circRNA-miRNA-mRNA in NeP was constructed. RESULTS: A total of 421 
      DEGs were identified, including 332 upregulated genes and 89 downregulated genes. 
      Ten hub genes, including IL6, Jun, Cd44, Timp1, and Csf1, were identified. Two 
      miRNAs, mmu-miR-181a-5p and mmu-miR-223-3p, were preliminarily verified as key 
      regulators of NeP development. In addition, circARHGAP5 and circLPHN3 were 
      identified as key circRNAs. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes 
      and Genomes (KEGG) analysis demonstrated that these differentially expressed 
      mRNAs and targeting miRNAs were involved in signal transduction, positive 
      regulation of receptor-mediated endocytosis and regulation of neuronal synaptic 
      plasticity. These findings have useful implications for the exploration of new 
      mechanisms and therapeutic targets for NeP. CONCLUSION: These newly identified 
      miRNAs and circRNAs in networks reveal potential diagnostic or therapeutic 
      targets for NeP.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The decreased osteogenic differentiation ability of mesenchymal stem 
      cells (MSCs) is one of the important reasons for SOP. Inhibition of Wnt signaling 
      in MSCs is closely related to SOP. Microtubule actin crosslinking factor 1 
      (MACF1) is an important regulator in Wnt/β-catenin signal transduction. However, 
      whether the specific expression of MACF1 in MSC regulates SOP and its mechanism 
      remains unclear. METHODS: We established MSC-specific Prrx1 (Prx1) 
      promoter-driven MACF1 conditional knock-in (MACF-KI) mice, naturally aged male 
      mice, and ovariectomized female mice models. Micro-CT, H&E staining, double 
      calcein labeling, and the three-point bending test were used to explore the 
      effects of MACF1 on bone formation and bone microstructure in the SOP mice model. 
      Bioinformatics analysis, ChIP-PCR, qPCR, and ALP staining were used to explore 
      the effects and mechanisms of MACF1 on MSCs' osteogenic differentiation. RESULTS: 
      Microarray analysis revealed that the expression of MACF1 and positive regulators 
      of the Wnt pathway (such as TCF4, β-catenin, Dvl) was decreased in human MSCs 
      (hMSCs) isolated from aged osteoporotic than non-osteoporotic patients. The ALP 
      activity and osteogenesis marker genes (Alp, Runx2, and Bglap) expression in 
      mouse MSCs was downregulated during aging. Furthermore, Micro-CT analysis of the 
      femur from 2-month-old MSC-specific Prrx1 (Prx1) promoter-driven MACF1 
      conditional knock-in (MACF-cKI) mice showed no significant trabecular bone 
      changes compared to wild-type littermate controls, whereas 18- and 21-month-old 
      MACF1 c-KI animals displayed increased bone mineral densities (BMD), improved 
      bone microstructure, and increased maximum compression stress. In addition, the 
      ovariectomy (OVX)-induced osteoporosis model of MACF1 c-KI mice had significantly 
      higher trabecular volume and number, and increased bone formation rate than that 
      in control mice. Mechanistically, ChIP-PCR showed that TCF4 could bind to the 
      promoter region of the host gene miR-335-5p. Moreover, MACF1 could regulate the 
      expression of miR-335-5p by TCF4 during the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. 
      CONCLUSION: These data indicate that MACF1 positively regulates MSCs osteogenesis 
      and bone formation through the TCF4/miR-335-5p signaling pathway in SOP, 
      suggesting that targeting MACF1 may be a novel therapeutic approach against SOP. 
      THE TRANSLATIONAL POTENTIAL OF THIS ARTICLE: MACF1, an important switch in the 
      Wnt signaling pathway, can alleviate SOP through the TCF4/miR-335-5p signaling 
      pathway in mice model. It might act as a therapeutic target for the treatment of 
      SOP to improve bone function.

AB  - Background: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal and irreversible 
      interstitial lung disease. The specific mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis 
      of IPF are not fully understood, while metabolic dysregulation has recently been 
      demonstrated to contribute to IPF. This study aims to identify key 
      metabolism-related genes involved in the progression of IPF, providing new 
      insights into the pathogenesis of IPF. Methods: We downloaded four datasets 
      (GSE32537, GSE110147, GSE150910, and GSE92592) from the Gene Expression Omnibus 
      (GEO) database and identified differentially expressed metabolism-related genes 
      (DEMRGs) in lung tissues of IPF by comprehensive analysis. Then, we performed GO, 
      KEGG, and Reactome enrichment analyses of the DEMRGs. Subsequently, key DEMRGs 
      were identified by machine-learning algorithms. Next, miRNAs regulating these key 
      DEMRGs were predicted by integrating the GSE32538 (IPF miRNA dataset) and the 
      miRWalk database. The Cytoscape software was used to visualize miRNA-mRNA 
      regulatory networks. In addition, the relative levels of immune cells were 
      assessed by the CIBERSORT algorithm, and the correlation of key DEMRGs with 
      immune cells was calculated. Finally, the mRNA expression of the key DEMRGs was 
      validated in two external independent datasets and an in vivo experiment. 
      Results: A total of 101 DEMRGs (51 upregulated and 50 downregulated) were 
      identified. Six key DEMRGs (ENPP3, ENTPD1, GPX3, PDE7B, PNMT, and POLR3H) were 
      further identified using two machine-learning algorithms (LASSO and SVM-RFE). In 
      the lung tissue of IPF patients, the expression levels of ENPP3, ENTPD1, and 
      PDE7B were upregulated, and the expression levels of GPX3, PNMT, and POLR3H were 
      downregulated. In addition, the miRNA-mRNA regulatory network of key DEMRGs was 
      constructed. Then, the expression levels of key DEMRGs were validated in two 
      independent external datasets (GSE53845 and GSE213001). Finally, we verified the 
      key DEMRGs in the lung tissue of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis mice by 
      qRT-PCR. Conclusion: Our study identified key metabolism-related genes that are 
      differentially expressed in the lung tissue of IPF patients. Our study emphasizes 
      the critical role of metabolic dysregulation in IPF, offers potential therapeutic 
      targets, and provides new insights for future studies.

TI  - Characteristics of circulating small noncoding RNAs in plasma and serum during 
      human aging.
PG  - 35-48
LID - 10.1002/agm2.12241 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Aging is a complicated process that triggers age-related disease 
      susceptibility through intercellular communication in the microenvironment. While 
      the classic secretome of senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) 
      including soluble factors, growth factors, and extracellular matrix remodeling 
      enzymes are known to impact tissue homeostasis during the aging process, the 
      effects of novel SASP components, extracellular small noncoding RNAs (sncRNAs), 
      on human aging are not well established. METHODS: Here, by utilizing 446 small 
      RNA-seq samples from plasma and serum of healthy donors found in the 
      Extracellular RNA (exRNA) Atlas data repository, we correlated linear and 
      nonlinear features between circulating sncRNAs expression and age by the maximal 
      information coefficient (MIC) relationship determination. Age predictors were 
      generated by ensemble machine learning methods (Adaptive Boosting, Gradient 
      Boosting, and Random Forest) and core age-related sncRNAs were determined through 
      weighted coefficients in machine learning models. Functional investigation was 
      performed via target prediction of age-related miRNAs. RESULTS: We observed the 
      number of highly expressed transfer RNAs (tRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) showed 
      positive and negative associations with age respectively. Two-variable (sncRNA 
      expression and individual age) relationships were detected by MIC and 
      sncRNAs-based age predictors were established, resulting in a forecast 
      performance where all R (2) values were greater than 0.96 and root-mean-square 
      errors (RMSE) were less than 3.7 years in three ensemble machine learning 
      methods. Furthermore, important age-related sncRNAs were identified based on 
      modeling and the biological pathways of age-related miRNAs were characterized by 
      their predicted targets, including multiple pathways in intercellular 
      communication, cancer and immune regulation. CONCLUSION: In summary, this study 
      provides valuable insights into circulating sncRNAs expression dynamics during 
      human aging and may lead to advanced understanding of age-related sncRNAs 
      functions with further elucidation.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a type of neurodegenerative disease 
      that has no effective treatment in its late stage, making the early prediction of 
      AD critical. There have been an increase in the number of studies indicating that 
      miRNAs play an important role in neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's 
      disease via epigenetic modifications including DNA methylation. Therefore, miRNAs 
      may serve as excellent biomarkers in early AD prediction. METHODS: Considering 
      that the non-coding RNAs' activity may be linked to their corresponding DNA loci 
      in the 3D genome, we collected the existing AD-related miRNAs combined with 3D 
      genomic data in this study. We investigated three machine learning models in this 
      work under leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV): support vector classification 
      (SVC), support vector regression (SVR), and knearest neighbors (KNNs). RESULTS: 
      The prediction results of different models demonstrated the effectiveness of 
      incorporating 3D genome information into the AD prediction models. DISCUSSION: 
      With the assistance of the 3D genome, we were able to train more accurate models 
      by selecting fewer but more discriminatory miRNAs, as witnessed by several ML 
      models. These interesting findings indicate that the 3D genome has great 
      potential to play an important role in future AD research.

AB  - Growth plate chondrocytes are regulated by numerous factors and hormones as they 
      mature during endochondral bone formation, including transforming growth factor 
      beta-1 (TGFb1), bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2), insulin-like growth factor-1 
      (IFG1), parathyroid hormone and parathyroid hormone related peptide (PTH, PTHrP), 
      and Indian hedgehog (IHH). Chondrocytes in the growth plate's growth zone (GC) 
      produce and export matrix vesicles (MVs) under the regulation of 
      1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) [1α,25(OH)(2)D(3)]. 1α,25(OH)(2)D(3) regulates MV 
      enzyme composition genomically and 1α,25(OH)(2)D(3) secreted by the cells acts on 
      the MV membrane nongenomically, destabilizing it and releasing MV enzymes. This 
      study examined the regulatory role 1α,25(OH)(2)D(3) has over production and 
      packaging of microRNA (miRNA) into MVs by GC cells and the release of miRNA by 
      direct action on MVs. Costochondral cartilage GC cells were treated with 
      1α,25(OH)(2)D(3) and the miRNA in the cells and MVs sequenced. We also treated 
      MVs with 1α,25(OH)(2)D(3) and determined if the miRNA was released. To assess 
      whether MVs can act directly with chondrocytes and if this is regulated by 
      1α,25(OH)(2)D(3), we stained MVs with a membrane dye and treated GC cells with 
      them. 1α,25(OH)(2)D(3) regulated production and packaging of a unique population 
      of miRNA into MVs compared to the vehicle control population. 1α,25(OH)(2)D(3) 
      treatment of MVs did not release miRNA. Stained MVs were endocytosed by GC cells 
      and this was increased with 1α,25(OH)(2)D(3) treatment. This study adds new 
      regulatory roles for 1α,25(OH)(2)D(3) with respect to packaging and transport of 
      MV miRNAs.

TI  - miRinGO: Prediction of Biological Processes Indirectly Targeted by Human 
      microRNAs.
LID - 10.3390/ncrna9010011 [doi]
LID - 11
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that are known for their role in the 
      post-transcriptional regulation of target genes. Typically, their functions are 
      predicted by first identifying their target genes and then finding biological 
      processes enriched in these targets. Current tools for miRNA functional analysis 
      use only genes with physical binding sites as their targets and exclude other 
      genes that are indirectly targeted transcriptionally through transcription 
      factors. Here, we introduce a method to predict gene ontology (GO) annotations 
      indirectly targeted by microRNAs. The proposed method resulted in better 
      performance in predicting known miRNA-GO term associations compared to the 
      canonical approach. To facilitate miRNA GO enrichment analysis, we developed an R 
      Shiny application, miRinGO, that is freely available online at GitHub.

TI  - Expression profiling analysis reveals key microRNA-mRNA interactions in patients 
      with transposition of the great arteries and systemic left and right ventricles.

LID - 1056427
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with transposition of the great arteries (TGA) have 
      different connected systemic chambers and this determines the long-term 
      morbidities and survival. Limited findings have been reported to systematically 
      identify miRNA and mRNA expression levels in such cohorts of patients. In this 
      study, we aimed to characterize miRNAs, mRNAs, and miRNA-mRNA interaction 
      networks in patients with TGA, with a systemic left (LV) and right ventricle 
      (RV). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Large panel of human miRNA and mRNA microarrays were 
      conducted to determine the genome-wide expression profiles in the blood of 16 
      TGA-RV patients, 16 TGA-LV patients, and 16 age and gender-matched controls. 
      Using real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), the differential expression level of 
      a single miRNA was validated. Enrichment analyses of altered miRNA and mRNA 
      expression levels were identified using bioinformatics tools. RESULTS: Altered 
      miRNA and mRNA expression levels were observed between TGA-RV and TGA-LV 
      patients, together or separated, compared to controls. Among the deregulated 
      miRNAs and mRNAs, 39 and 101 miRNAs were identified as significantly 
      differentially expressed in patients with TGA (both TGA-RV and TGA-LV) and 
      TGA-RV, when compared to matched controls. Furthermore, 51 miRNAs were identified 
      as significantly differentially expressed in patients with TGA-RV when compared 
      to patients with TGA-LV. RT-qPCR relative expression level was highly consistent 
      with microarray analysis results. Similarly, 36 and 164 mRNAs were identified as 
      significantly differentially expressed in patients with TGA (both TGA-RV and 
      TGA-LV) and TGA-RV, when compared to matched controls. Additionally, miR-140-3p 
      showed a higher expression level in patients with overt heart failure (FC = 1.54; 
      P = 0.001) and miR-502-3p showed a higher expression level in patients died due 
      to cardiac death (FC = 1.41; P = 0.011). Integrative analysis resulted in 21 and 
      23 target genes with higher and lower expression levels, respectively (r ≥ 0.50 
      and P < 0.05). These target genes (i.e., 21 and 23 target genes) showed an 
      inverse direction of regulation with miRNA and exhibited a miRNA binding site 
      position within the 3'UTR of the target gene. CONCLUSION: Our findings provide 
      new insights into a potential molecular biomarker(s) for patients with TGA that 
      may guide better risk stratification and the development of novel targeting 
      therapies. Future studies are needed to investigate the potential significance of 
      miRNAs and mRNAs in TGA-related cardiovascular diseases.

PG  - vbab040

LID - vbab040
AB  - It is well-known that some microRNAs (miRNAs) are more important than the others 
      for life, hinting the wide range of miRNA in essentiality or importance. 
      Functional enrichment analysis is a quite pervasive method to dig out the 
      underlying biological pathway for a given gene list and several tools of miRNA 
      set enrichment analysis have been developed. However, all those tools treat each 
      miRNA equally and neglect the importance score of miRNA itself, which could be an 
      obstacle to seek more insightful biological processes for researchers. Here, we 
      developed wTAM, a tool for annotation of weighted human miRNAs, introducing the 
      miRNA importance scores into enrichment analysis. In addition, the annotation 
      repository has been enlarged comparing to TAM. Finally, the case study 
      demonstrated the availability and flexibility of wTAM. AVAILABILITY AND 
      IMPLEMENTATION: wTAM is freely available at http://www.cuilab.cn/wtam/.

TI  - NcPath: a novel platform for visualization and enrichment analysis of human 
      non-coding RNA and KEGG signaling pathways.
LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/btac812 [doi]
LID - btac812
AB  - SUMMARY: Non-coding RNAs play important roles in transcriptional processes and 
      participate in the regulation of various biological functions, in particular 
      miRNAs and lncRNAs. Despite their importance for several biological functions, 
      the existing signaling pathway databases do not include information on miRNA and 
      lncRNA. Here, we redesigned a novel pathway database named NcPath by integrating 
      and visualizing a total of 178 308 human experimentally validated miRNA-target 
      interactions (MTIs), 32 282 experimentally verified lncRNA-target interactions 
      (LTIs) and 4837 experimentally validated human ceRNA networks across 222 KEGG 
      pathways (including 27 sub-categories). To expand the application potential of 
      the redesigned NcPath database, we identified 556 798 reliable 
      lncRNA-protein-coding genes (PCG) interaction pairs by integrating co-expression 
      relations, ceRNA relations, co-TF-binding interactions, co-histone-modification 
      interactions, cis-regulation relations and lncPro Tool predictions between 
      lncRNAs and PCG. In addition, to determine the pathways in which miRNA/lncRNA 
      targets are involved, we performed a KEGG enrichment analysis using a 
      hypergeometric test. The NcPath database also provides information on 
      MTIs/LTIs/ceRNA networks, PubMed IDs, gene annotations and the experimental 
      verification method used. In summary, the NcPath database will serve as an 
      important and continually updated platform that provides annotation and 
      visualization of the pathways on which non-coding RNAs (miRNA and lncRNA) are 
      involved, and provide support to multimodal non-coding RNAs enrichment analysis. 
      The NcPath database is freely accessible at http://ncpath.pianlab.cn/. 
      AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: NcPath database is freely available at 
      http://ncpath.pianlab.cn/. The code and manual to use NcPath can be found at 
      https://github.com/Marscolono/NcPath/. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary 
      data are available at Bioinformatics online.

TI  - Dynamic and static circulating cancer microRNA biomarkers - a validation study.
PG  - 1-9
LID - 10.1080/15476286.2022.2154470 [doi]
AB  - For cancers and other pathologies, early diagnosis remains the most promising 
      path to survival. Profiling of longitudinal cohorts facilitates insights into 
      trajectories of biomarkers. We measured microRNA expression in 240 serum samples 
      from patients with colon, lung, and breast cancer and from cancer-free controls. 
      Each patient provided at least two serum samples, one prior to diagnosis and one 
      following diagnosis. The median time interval between the samples was 11.6 years. 
      Using computational models, we evaluated the circulating profiles of 21 
      microRNAs. The analysis yielded two sets of biomarkers, static ones that show an 
      absolute difference between certain cancer types and controls and dynamic ones 
      where the level over time provided higher diagnostic information content. In the 
      first group, miR-99a-5p stands out for all three cancer types. In the second 
      group, miR-155-5p allows to predict lung cancers and colon cancers. 
      Classification in samples from cancer and non-cancer patients using gradient 
      boosted trees reached an average accuracy of 79.9%. The results suggest that 
      individual change over time or an absolute value at one time point may predict a 
      disease with high specificity and sensitivity.

AB  - Portal hypertension (PH) is an important cause of pulmonary arterial 
      hypertension(PAH), but its mechanism is still unclear. We used genetic data 
      analysis to explore the shared genes and molecular mechanisms of PH and PAH. We 
      downloaded the PH and PAH data from the GEO database, and used the weighted gene 
      coexpression network analysis method (WGCNA) to analyze the coexpression modules 
      of idiopathic noncirrhotic portal hypertension (INCPH) and cirrhotic portal 
      hypertension (CPH) and pulmonary hypertension, respectively. Enrichment analysis 
      was performed on the common genes, and differential gene expressions (DEGs) were 
      used for verification. The target genes of INCPH and PAH were obtained by string 
      and cytoscape software, and the miRNAs of target genes were predicted by miRwalk, 
      miRDB, and TargetScan and their biological functions were analyzed; finally, we 
      used PanglaoDB to predict the expression of target genes in cells. In WGCNA, gene 
      modules significantly related to PAH, CPH, and INCPH were identified, and 
      enrichment function analysis showed that the common pathway of PAH and CPH were 
      "P53 signaling pathway," "synthesis of neutral lipids"; PAH and INCPH are 
      "terminal," "Maintenance Regulation of Granules," and "Toxin Transport." DEGs 
      confirmed the results of WGCNA; the common miRNA functions of PAH and cirrhosis 
      were enriched for "P53 signaling pathway," "TGF-β signaling pathway," "TNF 
      signaling pathway," and "fatty acid metabolism," and the miRNAs-mRNAs network 
      suggested that hsa-miR-22a-3p regulates MDM2 and hsa-miR-34a-5p regulates PRDX4; 
      the target genes of PAH and INCPH are EIF5B, HSPA4, GNL3, RARS, UTP20, HNRNPA2B1, 
      HSP90B1, METAP2, NARS, SACM1L, and their target miRNA function enrichment showed 
      EIF5B, HNRNPA2B1, HSP90B1, METAP2, NARS, SACM1L, and HSPA4 are associated with 
      telomeres and inflammation, panglaoDB showed that target genes are located in 
      endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, etc. In conclusion, the mechanism of 
      pulmonary hypertension induced by portal hypertension may be related to telomere 
      dysfunction and P53 overactivation, and lipid metabolism and intestinal 
      inflammation are also involved in this process.

TI  - Identifying Hub Genes Associated with Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Resistance in 
      Breast Cancer and Potential Drug Repurposing for the Development of Precision 
      Medicine.

AB  - Breast cancer is the second leading cause of morbidity and mortality in women 
      worldwide. Despite advancements in the clinical application of neoadjuvant 
      chemotherapy (NAC), drug resistance remains a major concern hindering treatment 
      efficacy. Thus, identifying the key genes involved in driving NAC resistance and 
      targeting them with known potential FDA-approved drugs could be applied to 
      advance the precision medicine strategy. With this aim, we performed an 
      integrative bioinformatics study to identify the key genes associated with NAC 
      resistance in breast cancer and then performed the drug repurposing to identify 
      the potential drugs which could use in combination with NAC to overcome drug 
      resistance. In this study, we used publicly available RNA-seq datasets from the 
      samples of breast cancer patients sensitive and resistant to chemotherapy and 
      identified a total of 1446 differentially expressed genes in NAC-resistant breast 
      cancer patients. Next, we performed gene co-expression network analysis to 
      identify significantly co-expressed gene modules, followed by MCC (Multiple 
      Correlation Clustering) clustering algorithms and identified 33 key hub genes 
      associated with NAC resistance. mRNA-miRNA network analysis highlighted the 
      potential impact of these hub genes in altering the regulatory network in 
      NAC-resistance breast cancer cells. Further, several hub genes were found to be 
      significantly involved in the poor overall survival of breast cancer patients. 
      Finally, we identified FDA-approved drugs which could be useful for potential 
      drug repurposing against those hub genes. Altogether, our findings provide new 
      insight into the molecular mechanisms of NAC resistance and pave the way for drug 
      repurposing techniques and personalized treatment to overcome NAC resistance in 
      breast cancer.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Preterm birth remains a major public health issue affecting 10% of 
      all pregnancies and increases risks of neonatal morbidity and mortality. 
      Approximately 50% to 60% of preterm births are spontaneous, resulting from 
      preterm premature rupture of membranes or preterm labor. The pathogenesis of 
      spontaneous preterm birth is incompletely understood, and prediction of preterm 
      birth remains elusive. Accurate prediction of preterm birth would reduce infant 
      morbidity and mortality through targeted patient referral to hospitals equipped 
      to care for preterm infants. Two previous studies have analyzed cervical 
      microRNAs in association with spontaneous preterm birth and the length of 
      gestation, but the extent to which microRNAs serve as predictive biomarkers 
      remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine associations between 
      cervical microRNA expression and spontaneous preterm birth, with the specific 
      goal of identifying a subset of microRNAs that predict spontaneous preterm birth. 
      STUDY DESIGN: We performed a prospective, nested, case-control study of 25 cases 
      with spontaneous preterm birth and 49 term controls. Controls were matched to 
      cases in a 2:1 ratio on the basis of age, parity, and self-identified race. 
      Cervical swabs were collected at a mean gestational age of 17.1 (4.8) weeks of 
      gestation, and microRNAs were analyzed using a quantitative polymerase chain 
      reaction array. Normalized microRNA expression was compared between cases and 
      controls, and a false discovery rate of 0.2 was applied to account for multiple 
      comparisons. Histopathologic analysis of slides of cervical swab samples was 
      performed to quantify leukocyte burden for adjustment in conditional regression 
      models. We explored the use of Relief-based unsupervised identification of top 
      microRNAs and support vector machines to predict spontaneous preterm birth. We 
      performed microRNA enrichment analysis to explore potential biologic targets and 
      pathways in which up-regulated microRNAs might be involved. RESULTS: Of the 754 
      microRNAs on the polymerase chain reaction array, 346 were detected in ≥75% of 
      participants' cervical swabs. Average cervical microRNA expression was 
      significantly higher in cases of spontaneous preterm birth than in controls 
      (P=.01). There were 95 significantly up-regulated individual microRNAs (>2-fold 
      change) in cases of subsequent spontaneous preterm birth compared with term 
      controls (P<.05; q<0.2). Notably, miR-143, miR-30e-3p, and miR-199b were all 
      significantly up-regulated, which is consistent with the 1 previous study of 
      cervical microRNA and spontaneous preterm birth. A Relief-based, novel variable 
      (feature) selection machine learning approach had low-to-moderate prediction 
      accuracy, with an area under the receiver operating curve of 0.71. Enrichment 
      analysis revealed that identified microRNAs may modulate inflammatory cell 
      signaling. CONCLUSION: In this prospective nested case-control study of cervical 
      microRNA expression and spontaneous preterm birth, we identified a global 
      increase in microRNA expression and up-regulation of 95 distinct microRNAs in 
      association with subsequent spontaneous preterm birth. Larger and more diverse 
      studies are required to determine the ability of microRNAs to accurately predict 
      spontaneous preterm birth, and mechanistic work to facilitate development of 
      novel therapeutic interventions to prevent spontaneous preterm birth is 
      warranted.

AB  - In recent years, malignant breast cancer metastasis has caused a great increase 
      in mortality. Research on the genetic and molecular mechanisms of malignant 
      breast cancer has continued to deepen, and targeted therapy has become the 
      general trend. Among them, competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA)-related molecules 
      have received much attention. Homeobox transcript antisense RNA (HOTAIR) has been 
      reported to function extensively as a ceRNA in breast cancer. Notably, miR-203 
      and Caveolin 1 (CAV1) have also been found to play a role in breast cancer. 
      However, the relationship between the three remains unclear. In this study, we 
      present a new mechanic through bioinformatics tool and basic experiments: the 
      HOTAIR/miR-203/CAV1 axis, which complemented the role network of HOTAIR as a 
      ceRNA, thus, it will provide a novel potential idea for breast cancer research 
      and therapy.

AB  - Exercise affects the expression of microRNAs (miR/s) and muscle-derived 
      extracellular vesicles (EVs). To evaluate sarcoplasmic and secreted miR 
      expression in human skeletal muscle in response to exercise-mimetic contractile 
      activity, we utilized a three-dimensional tissue-engineered model of human 
      skeletal muscle ("myobundles"). Myobundles were subjected to three culture 
      conditions: no electrical stimulation (CTL), chronic low frequency stimulation 
      (CLFS), or intermittent high frequency stimulation (IHFS) for 7 days. RNA was 
      isolated from myobundles and from extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted by 
      myobundles into culture media; miR abundance was analyzed by miRNA-sequencing. We 
      used edgeR and a within-sample design to evaluate differential miR expression and 
      Pearson correlation to evaluate correlations between myobundle and EV populations 
      within treatments with statistical significance set at p < 0.05. Numerous miRs 
      were differentially expressed between myobundles and EVs; 116 miRs were 
      differentially expressed within CTL, 3 within CLFS, and 2 within IHFS. 
      Additionally, 25 miRs were significantly correlated (18 in CTL, 5 in CLFS, 2 in 
      IHFS) between myobundles and EVs. Electrical stimulation resulted in differential 
      expression of 8 miRs in myobundles and only 1 miR in EVs. Several KEGG pathways, 
      known to play a role in regulation of skeletal muscle, were enriched, with 
      differentially overrepresented miRs between myobundle and EV populations 
      identified using miEAA. Together, these results demonstrate that in vitro 
      exercise-mimetic contractile activity of human engineered muscle affects both 
      their expression of miRs and number of secreted EVs. These results also identify 
      novel miRs of interest for future studies of the role of exercise in organ-organ 
      interactions in vivo.

AB  - Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer with a high fatality rate amongst women 
      worldwide. Diagnosing at an early stage is challenging, and due to the 
      limitations of the currently used techniques, including mammography and imaging 
      diagnostics, it still remains unascertained. Serum biomarkers can be a solution 
      for this as they can be isolated in a less painful, more cost-effective, and 
      minimally invasive manner. In this study, we shed light on the relevant role of 
      multiple microRNAs (miRNAs) as potential biomarkers in breast cancer diagnosis. 
      We monitored the expressional changes of 15 pre-selected miRNAs in a large 
      cohort, including 65 patients with breast cancer and 42 healthy individuals. We 
      performed thorough statistical analyses on the cohort sample set and determined 
      the diagnostic accuracy of individual and multiple miRNAs. Our study reveals a 
      potential improvement in diagnostics by implicating the monitoring of 
      miR-15a+miR-16+miR-221 expression in breast cancer management.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Preterm birth (PTB) is a multifactorial syndrome that seriously 
      threatens the health of pregnant women and babies worldwide. Recently, circular 
      RNAs (circRNAs) have been understood as important regulators of various 
      physiological and pathological processes. However, the expression pattern and 
      potential roles of circRNAs in PTB are largely unclear. METHODS: In this study, 
      we extracted and analyzed the circRNA expression profiles in maternal and fetal 
      samples of preterm and term pregnancies, including maternal plasma, maternal 
      monocytes, myometrium, chorion, placenta, and cord blood. We identified the 
      circRNAs which is associated with PTB in different tissues and explored their 
      relationships from the perspective of the overall maternal-fetal system. 
      Furthermore, co-expression analysis of circRNAs and mRNAs, target microRNAs 
      (miRNAs), and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), provided new clues about possible 
      mechanisms of circRNA function in PTB. In the end, we investigated the potential 
      special biofunctions of circRNAs in different tissues and their common features 
      and communication in PTB. RESULTS: Significant differences in circRNA types and 
      expression levels between preterm and term groups have been proved, as well as 
      between tissues. Nevertheless, there were still some PTB-related differentially 
      expressed circRNAs (DECs) shared by these tissues. The functional enrichment 
      analysis showed that the DECs putatively have important tissue-specific 
      biofunctions through their target miRNA and co-expressed mRNAs, which contribute 
      to the signature pathologic changes of each tissue within the maternal-fetal 
      system in PTB (e.g., the contraction of the myometrium). Moreover, DECs in 
      different tissues might have some common biological activities, which are mainly 
      the activation of immune-inflammatory processes (e.g., interleukin1/6/8/17, 
      chemokine, TLRs, and complement). CONCLUSIONS: In summary, our data provide a 
      preliminary blueprint for the expression and possible roles of circRNAs in PTB, 
      which lays the foundation for future research on the mechanisms of circRNAs in 
      PTB.

AB  - Background: Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) lack tumor-specific 
      biomarkers. Exosomes from HNSCC patients carry immunomodulatory molecules, and 
      correlate with clinical parameters. We compared miRNA profiles of plasma- and 
      saliva-derived exosomes to reveal liquid biomarker candidates for HNSCC. Methods: 
      Exosomes were isolated by differential ultracentrifugation from corresponding 
      plasma and saliva samples from 11 HNSCC patients and five healthy donors (HD). 
      Exosomal miRNA profiles, as determined by nCounter(®) SPRINT technology, were 
      analyzed regarding their diagnostic and prognostic potential, correlated to 
      clinical data and integrated into network analysis. Results: 119 miRNAs 
      overlapped between plasma- and saliva-derived exosomes of HNSCC patients, from 
      which 29 tumor-exclusive miRNAs, associated with TP53, TGFB1, PRDM1, FOX O 1 and 
      CDH1 signaling, were selected. By intra-correlation of tumor-exclusive miRNAs 
      from plasma and saliva, top 10 miRNA candidates with the strongest correlation 
      emerged as diagnostic panels to discriminate cancer and healthy as well as 
      potentially prognostic panels for disease-free survival (DFS). Further, exosomal 
      miRNAs were differentially represented in human papillomavirus (HPV) positive and 
      negative as well as low and high stage disease. Conclusion: A plasma- and a 
      saliva-derived panel of tumor-exclusive exosomal miRNAs hold great potential as 
      liquid biopsy for discrimination between cancer and healthy as well as HPV status 
      and disease stage. Exosomal miRNAs from both biofluids represent a promising tool 
      for future biomarker studies, emphasizing the possibility to substitute plasma by 
      less-invasive saliva collection.

AB  - Acute respiratory distress syndrome is a heterogeneous pathophysiological process 
      responsible for significant morbidity and mortality in pediatric intensive care 
      patients. Diagnosis is defined by clinical characteristics that identify the 
      syndrome after development. Subphenotyping patients at risk of progression to 
      ARDS could provide the opportunity for therapeutic intervention. microRNAs, 
      non-coding RNAs stable in circulation, are a promising biomarker candidate. We 
      conducted a single-center prospective cohort study to evaluate random forest 
      classification of microarray-quantified circulating microRNAs in critically ill 
      pediatric patients. We additionally selected a sub-cohort for parallel 
      metabolomics profiling as a pilot study for concurrent use of miRNAs and 
      metabolites as circulating biomarkers. In 35 patients (n = 21 acute respiratory 
      distress, n = 14 control) 15 microRNAs were differentially expressed. 
      Unsupervised random forest classification accurately grouped ARDS and control 
      patients with an area under the curve of 0.762, which was improved to 0.839 when 
      subset to only patients with bacterial infection. Nine metabolites were 
      differentially abundant between acute respiratory distress and control patients 
      (n = 4, both groups) and abundance was highly correlated with miRNA expression. 
      Random forest classification of microRNAs differentiated critically ill pediatric 
      patients who developed acute respiratory distress relative to those who do not. 
      The differential expression of microRNAs and metabolites provides a strong 
      foundation for further work to validate their use as a prognostic biomarker.

TI  - Serum MicroRNAs Predict Isolated Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Behavior Disorder and 
      Lewy Body Diseases.
PG  - 2086-2098
LID - 10.1002/mds.29171 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Isolated rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (IRBD) is a 
      well-established clinical risk factor for Lewy body diseases (LBDs), such as 
      Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). OBJECTIVE: To 
      elucidate whether serum microRNA (miRNA) deregulation in IRBD can antedate the 
      diagnosis of LBD by performing a longitudinal study in different progression 
      stages of IRBD before and after LBD diagnosis and assessing the predictive 
      performance of differentially expressed miRNAs by machine learning-based 
      modeling. METHODS: Using genome-wide miRNA analysis and real-time quantitative 
      polymerase chain reaction validation, we assessed serum miRNA profiles from 
      patients with IRBD stratified by dopamine transporter (DaT) single-photon 
      emission computed tomography into DaT-negative IRBD (n = 17) and DaT-positive 
      IRBD (n = 21), IRBD phenoconverted into LBD (n = 13), and controls (n = 20). 
      Longitudinally, we followed up the IRBD cohort by studying three time point serum 
      samples over 26 months. RESULTS: We found sustained cross-sectional and 
      longitudinal deregulation of 12 miRNAs across the RBD continuum, including 
      DaT-negative IRBD, DaT-positive IRBD, and LBD phenoconverted IRBD (let-7c-5p, 
      miR-19b-3p, miR-140, miR-22-3p, miR-221-3p, miR-24-3p, miR-25-3p, miR-29c-3p, 
      miR-361-5p, miR-425-5p, miR-4505, and miR-451a) (false discovery rate P < 0.05). 
      Age- and sex-adjusted predictive modeling based on the 12 differentially 
      expressed miRNA biosignatures discriminated IRBD and PD or DLB from controls with 
      an area under the curve of 98% (95% confidence interval: 89-99%). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Besides clinical diagnosis of IRBD or imaging markers such as DaT single-photon 
      emission computed tomography, specific miRNA biosignatures alone hold promise as 
      progression biomarkers for patients with IRBD for predicting PD and DLB clinical 
      outcomes. Further miRNA studies in other PD at-risk populations, such as LRRK2 
      mutation asymptomatic carriers or hyposmic subjects, are warranted. © 2022 The

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Periodontal disease has been associated with pregnancy complications 
      including preeclampsia. This bioinformatic study is aimed at investigating the 
      possible role of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) as mediators of the association 
      between maternal periodontal disease and preeclampsia. METHODS: Peripheral blood 
      miRNA profiles of periodontitis and controls were sought from Gene Expression 
      Omnibus (GEO), and differential expression analysis was performed. Experimentally 
      validated circulating miRNAs associated with preeclampsia were determined from 
      the Human MicroRNA Disease Database (HMDD v3.0). Venn diagrams were drawn to 
      identify shared circulating differential miRNAs (DEmiRNAs). Significantly 
      enriched target genes, KEGG pathways, and Gene Ontology (GO) terms for the set of 
      shared DEmiRNA were predicted using miRNA enrichment analysis and annotation tool 
      (miEAA v 2.0). Additionally, the shared DEmiRNA-enriched target genes were 
      analyzed for enriched WikiPathways, BioCarta metabolic pathways, and tissue 
      proteins in the human proteome map. RESULTS: Among 183 circulating DEmiRNA in 
      periodontitis and 60 experimentally validated miRNA in preeclampsia, 9 shared 
      DEmiRNA were identified. The top among 32 overrepresented target genes included 
      MAFB, PSAP, and CDK5RAP2, top among 14 enriched KEGG pathways were 
      renin-angiotensin system and graft-versus-host disease, and that among enriched 
      44 GO profiles included "positive regulation of epidermal growth factor-activated 
      receptor activity" and "sequestering of calcium ion." In the overrepresented 
      target gene set, among 10 enriched WikiPathways, the top included "NAD 
      metabolism, sirtuins, and aging" and "regulation of Wnt/B-catenin signaling by 
      small molecule compounds" and PPAR-related mechanisms was top among 13 enriched 
      BioCarta metabolic pathways. CONCLUSION: A circulating 9-DEmiRNA set was 
      significantly linked to both periodontitis and preeclampsia. Enrichment analysis 
      identified specific genes, pathways, and functional mechanisms, which may be 
      epigenetically altered and thereby mediate the biological association of 
      periodontitis and preeclampsia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Opioid use disorder (OUD), which is most commonly exhibited as 
      addiction, is a persistent chronic disease that places a burden on families and 
      society. Various peripheral traits have been linked to OUD in the past, but 
      research on this topic is insufficient. METHODS: Seven male patients with OUD and 
      7 male healthy controls with matched demographic and clinical data were enrolled 
      in this study. Peripheral blood RNA was used to construct an rRNA-removed library 
      and a small RNA library. The peripheral transcriptomic differences between the 
      two groups were investigated using RNA-seq. Differentially expressed messenger 
      RNAs (mRNAs), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), circular RNAs (circRNAs) and 
      microRNAs (miRNAs) were identified by bioinformatics methods, and functional 
      enrichment analysis with differentially expressed RNAs was performed to 
      investigate the potential biological mechanisms of OUD. RESULTS: A total of 229 
      mRNAs (115 upregulated, 114 downregulated), 416 lncRNAs (191 upregulated, 225 
      downregulated), 17 circRNAs (16 upregulated, 1 downregulated) and 74 miRNAs (42 
      upregulated, 32 downregulated) were differentially expressed between the OUD 
      group and the healthy control group. Functional enrichment analysis with 
      differentially expressed mRNAs showed that immunity, GnRH secretion, and PI3K-Akt 
      signaling pathways were associated with OUD. Immunity-, JAK-STAT-, and 
      insulin-related pathways were enriched in functional enrichment analysis of 
      target genes predicted by differentially expressed miRNAs. CONCLUSION: We 
      identified hundreds of differentially expressed genes that were enriched in 
      immunity, GnRH secretion and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways. Some genes with 
      significant changes might be used as potential biomarkers for progression and 
      treatment of OUD.

TI  - Dysregulated miRNAs as Biomarkers and Therapeutical Targets in Neurodegenerative 
      Diseases.
LID - 10.3390/jpm12050770 [doi]
LID - 770
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Amyotrophic Lateral 
      Sclerosis (ALS) are representative neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) characterized 
      by degeneration of selective neurons, as well as the lack of effective biomarkers 
      and therapeutic treatments. In the last decade, microRNAs (miRNAs) have gained 
      considerable interest in diagnostics and therapy of NDs, owing to their aberrant 
      expression and their ability to target multiple molecules and pathways. Here, we 
      provide an overview of dysregulated miRNAs in fluids (blood or cerebrospinal 
      fluid) and nervous tissue of AD, PD, and ALS patients. By emphasizing those that 
      are commonly dysregulated in these NDs, we highlight their potential role as 
      biomarkers or therapeutical targets and describe the use of antisense 
      oligonucleotides as miRNA therapies.

AB  - Cryptococcal meningoencephalitis (CM) is emerging as an infection in HIV/AIDS 
      patients shifted from primarily ART-naive to ART-experienced individuals, as well 
      as patients with COVID-19 and immunocompetent hosts. This fungal infection is 
      mainly caused by the opportunistic human pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans. Brain 
      or central nervous system (CNS) dissemination is the deadliest process for this 
      disease; however, mechanisms underlying this process have yet to be elucidated. 
      Moreover, illustrations of clinically relevant responses in cryptococcosis are 
      currently limited due to the low availability of clinical samples. In this study, 
      to explore the clinically relevant responses during C. neoformans infection, 
      macaque and mouse infection models were employed and miRNA-mRNA transcriptomes 
      were performed and combined, which revealed cytoskeleton, a major feature of 
      HIV/AIDS patients, was a centric pathway regulated in both infection models. 
      Notably, assays of clinical immune cells confirmed an enhanced macrophage "Trojan 
      Horse" in patients with HIV/AIDS, which could be shut down by cytoskeleton 
      inhibitors. Furthermore, myocilin, encoded by MYOC, was found to be a novel 
      enhancer for the macrophage "Trojan Horse," and an enhanced fungal burden was 
      achieved in the brains of MYOC-transgenic mice. Taken together, the findings from 
      this study reveal fundamental roles of the cytoskeleton and MYOC in fungal CNS 
      dissemination, which not only helps to understand the high prevalence of CM in 
      HIV/AIDS but also facilitates the development of novel therapeutics for 
      meningoencephalitis caused by C. neoformans and other pathogenic microorganisms.

PG  - W280-W289
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkac395 [doi]
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that are among the main 
      post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression. A number of data collections 
      and prediction tools have gathered putative or confirmed targets of these 
      regulators. It is often useful, for discovery and validation, to harness such 
      collections to perform target enrichment analysis in given transcriptional 
      signatures or gene-sets in order to predict involved miRNAs. While several 
      methods have been proposed to this end, a flexible and user-friendly interface 
      for such analyses using various approaches and collections is lacking. enrichMiR 
      (https://ethz-ins.org/enrichMiR/) addresses this gap by enabling users to perform 
      a series of enrichment tests, based on several target collections, to rank miRNAs 
      according to their likely involvement in the control of a given transcriptional 
      signature or gene-set. enrichMiR results can furthermore be visualised through 
      interactive and publication-ready plots. To guide the choice of the appropriate 
      analysis method, we benchmarked various tests across a panel of experiments 
      involving the perturbation of known miRNAs. Finally, we showcase enrichMiR 
      functionalities in a pair of use cases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Lung cancer (LC) is a leading cause of cancer-deaths globally. Its 
      lethality is due in large part to the paucity of accurate screening markers. 
      Precision Medicine includes the use of omics technology and novel analytic 
      approaches for biomarker development. We combined Artificial Intelligence (AI) 
      and DNA methylation analysis of circulating cell-free tumor DNA (ctDNA), to 
      identify putative biomarkers for and to elucidate the pathogenesis of LC. 
      METHODS: Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip array analysis was used to 
      measure cytosine (CpG) methylation changes across the genome in LC. Six different 
      AI platforms including support vector machine (SVM) and Deep Learning (DL) were 
      used to identify CpG biomarkers and for LC detection. Training set and validation 
      sets were generated, and 10-fold cross validation performed. Gene enrichment 
      analysis using g:profiler and GREAT enrichment was used to elucidate the LC 
      pathogenesis. RESULTS: Using a stringent GWAS significance threshold, p-value 
      <5x10(-8), we identified 4389 CpGs (cytosine methylation loci) in coding genes 
      and 1812 CpGs in non-protein coding DNA regions that were differentially 
      methylated in LC. SVM and three other AI platforms achieved an AUC=1.00; 95% CI 
      (0.90-1.00) for LC detection. DL achieved an AUC=1.00; 95% CI (0.95-1.00) and 
      100% sensitivity and specificity. High diagnostic accuracies were achieved with 
      only intragenic or only intergenic CpG loci. Gene enrichment analysis found 
      dysregulation of molecular pathways involved in the development of small cell and 
      non-small cell LC. CONCLUSION: Using AI and DNA methylation analysis of ctDNA, 
      high LC detection rates were achieved. Further, many of the genes that were 
      epigenetically altered are known to be involved in the biology of neoplasms in 
      general and lung cancer in particular.

TI  - Sex-Specific Differences in MicroRNA Expression During Human Fetal Lung 
      Development.
PG  - 762834

LID - 762834
AB  - Background: Sex-specific differences in fetal lung maturation have been well 
      described; however, little is known about the sex-specific differences in 
      microRNA (miRNA) expression during human fetal lung development. Interestingly, 
      many adult chronic lung diseases also demonstrate sex-specific differences in 
      prevalence. The developmental origins of health and disease hypothesis suggests 
      that these sex-specific differences in fetal lung development may influence 
      disease susceptibility later in life. In this study, we performed miRNA 
      sequencing on human fetal lung tissue samples to investigate differential 
      expression of miRNAs between males and females in the pseudoglandular stage of 
      lung development. We hypothesized that differences in miRNA expression are 
      present between sexes in early human lung development and may contribute to the 
      sex-specific differences seen in pulmonary diseases later in life. Methods: RNA 
      was isolated from human fetal lung tissue samples for miRNA sequencing. The count 
      of each miRNA was modeled by sex using negative binomial regression models in 
      DESeq2, adjusting for post-conception age, age(2), smoke exposure, batch, and RUV 
      factors. We tested for differential expression of miRNAs by sex, and for the 
      presence of sex-by-age interactions to determine if miRNA expression levels by 
      age were distinct between males and females. Results: miRNA expression profiles 
      were generated on 298 samples (166 males and 132 females). Of the 809 miRNAs 
      expressed in human fetal lung tissue during the pseudoglandular stage of lung 
      development, we identified 93 autosomal miRNAs that were significantly 
      differentially expressed by sex and 129 miRNAs with a sex-specific pattern of 
      miRNA expression across the course of the pseudoglandular period. Conclusion: Our 
      study demonstrates differential expression of numerous autosomal miRNAs between 
      the male and female developing human lung. Additionally, the expression of some 
      miRNAs are modified by age across the pseudoglandular stage in a sex-specific 
      way. Some of these differences in miRNA expression may impact susceptibility to 
      pulmonary disease later in life. Our results suggest that sex-specific miRNA 
      expression during human lung development may be a potential mechanism to explain 
      sex-specific differences in lung development and may impact subsequent disease 
      susceptibility.

AB  - BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding RNA that can 
      downregulate their targets by selectively binding to the 3' untranslated region 
      (3'UTR) of most messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in the human genome. MiRNAs can interact 
      with other molecules such as viruses and act as a mediator for viral infection. 
      In this study, we examined whether, and to what extent, the SARS-CoV-2 virus can 
      serve as a "sponge" for human miRNAs. RESULTS: We identified multiple potential 
      miRNA/target pairs that may be disrupted during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Using miRNA 
      expression profiles and RNA-seq from published studies, we further identified a 
      highly confident list of 5 miRNA/target pairs that could be disrupted by the 
      virus's miRNA sponge effect, namely hsa-miR-374a-5p/APOL6, 
      hsa-let-7f-1-3p/EIF4A2, hsa-miR-374a-3p/PARP11, hsa-miR-548d-3p/PSMA2 and 
      hsa-miR-23b-3p/ZNFX1 pairs. Using single-cell RNA-sequencing based data, we 
      identified two important miRNAs, hsa-miR-302c-5p and hsa-miR-16-5p, to be 
      potential virus targeting miRNAs across multiple cell types from bronchoalveolar 
      lavage fluid samples. We further validated some of our findings using miRNA and 
      gene enrichment analyses and the results confirmed with findings from previous 
      studies that some of these identified miRNA/target pairs are involved in ACE2 
      receptor network, regulating pro-inflammatory cytokines and in immune cell 
      maturation and differentiation. CONCLUSION: Using publicly available databases 
      and patient-related expression data, we found that acting as a "miRNA sponge" 
      could be one explanation for SARS-CoV-2-mediated pathophysiological changes. This 
      study provides a novel way of utilizing SARS-CoV-2 related data, with 
      bioinformatics approaches, to help us better understand the etiology of the 
      disease and its differential manifestation across individuals.

TI  - An Alternative Class of Targets for microRNAs Containing CG Dinucleotide.
LID - 10.3390/biology11030478 [doi]
LID - 478
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous ~23 nt RNAs which regulate message RNA (mRNA) 
      targets mainly through perfect pairing with their seed region (positions 2-7). 
      Several instances of UTR sequence with an additional nucleotide that might form a 
      bulge within the pairing region, can also be recognized by miRNA as their target 
      (bugle-target). But the prevalence of such imperfect base pairings in human and 
      their roles in the evolution are incompletely understood. We found that human 
      miRNAs with the CG dinucleotides (CG dimer) in their seed region have a 
      significant low mutation rate than their putative binding sites in mRNA targets. 
      Interspecific comparation shows that these miRNAs had very few conservative 
      targets with the perfect seed-pairing, while potentially having a subclass of 
      bulge-targets. Compared with the canonical target (perfect seed-pairing), these 
      bulge-targets had a lower negative correlation with the miRNA expression, and 
      either were down-regulated in the miRNA overexpression experiment or up-regulated 
      in the miRNA knock-down experiment. Our results show that the bulge-targets are 
      widespread in the miRNAs with CG dinucleotide within their seed regions, which 
      could in part explain the rare conserved targets of these miRNAs based on seed 
      rule. Incorporating these bulge-targets, together with conservation information, 
      could more accurately predict the entire targets of these miRNAs.

TI  - Functional Enrichment Analysis of Regulatory Elements.
LID - 10.3390/biomedicines10030590 [doi]
LID - 590
AB  - Statistical methods for enrichment analysis are important tools to extract 
      biological information from omics experiments. Although these methods have been 
      widely used for the analysis of gene and protein lists, the development of 
      high-throughput technologies for regulatory elements demands dedicated 
      statistical and bioinformatics tools. Here, we present a set of enrichment 
      analysis methods for regulatory elements, including CpG sites, miRNAs, and 
      transcription factors. Statistical significance is determined via a power 
      weighting function for target genes and tested by the Wallenius noncentral 
      hypergeometric distribution model to avoid selection bias. These new 
      methodologies have been applied to the analysis of a set of miRNAs associated 
      with arrhythmia, showing the potential of this tool to extract biological 
      information from a list of regulatory elements. These new methods are available 
      in GeneCodis 4, a web tool able to perform singular and modular enrichment 
      analysis that allows the integration of heterogeneous information.

TI  - Serological profiling reveals hsa-miR-451a as a possible biomarker of 
      anaphylaxis.

LID - e156669
AB  - BackgroundThere is a need to support the diagnosis of anaphylaxis by objective 
      markers. miRNAs are promising noncoding RNA species that may serve as serological 
      biomarkers, but their use in diagnosing anaphylaxis has not been systematically 
      studied to our knowledge. We aimed to comprehensively investigate serum biomarker 
      profiles (proteins, lipids, and miRNAs) to support the diagnosis of 
      anaphylaxis.MethodsAdult patients admitted to the emergency room with a diagnosis 
      of anaphylaxis (<3 hours) were included. Blood samples were taken upon emergency 
      room arrival and 1 month later.ResultsNext-generation sequencing of 18 samples (6 
      patients with anaphylaxis in both acute and nonacute condition, for 12 total 
      samples, and 6 healthy controls) identified hsa-miR-451a to be elevated during 
      anaphylaxis, which was verified by quantitative real-time PCR in the remaining 
      cohort. The random forest classifier enabled us to classify anaphylaxis with high 
      accuracy using a composite model. We identified tryptase, 9α,11β-PGF2, 
      apolipoprotein A1, and hsa-miR-451a as serological biomarkers of anaphylaxis. 
      These predictors qualified as serological biomarkers individually but performed 
      better in combination.ConclusionUnexpectedly, hsa-miR-451a was identified as the 
      most relevant biomarker in our data set. We were also able to distinguish between 
      patients with a history of anaphylaxis and healthy individuals with higher 
      accuracy than any other available model. Future studies will need to verify miRNA 
      biomarker utility in real-life clinical settings.FundingThis work is funded by

TI  - A data-driven biocomputing pipeline with meta-analysis on high throughput 
      transcriptomics to identify genome-wide miRNA markers associated with type 2 
      diabetes.
PG  - e08886
LID - 10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e08886 [doi]
LID - e08886
AB  - BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are sought-after biomarkers of complex, polygenic 
      diseases such as type 2 diabetes (T2D). Data-driven biocomputing provides robust 
      and novel avenues for synthesizing evidence from individual miRNA seq studies. 
      OBJECTIVE: To identify miRNA markers associated with T2D, via a data-driven, 
      biocomputing approach on high throughput transcriptomics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      The pipeline consisted of five sequential steps using miRNA seq data retrieved 
      from the National Center for Biotechnology Information Gene Expression Omnibus 
      platform: systematic review; identification of differentially expressed miRNAs 
      (DE-miRNAs); meta-analysis of DE-miRNAs; network analysis; and downstream 
      analyses. Three normalization algorithms (trimmed mean of M-values; upper 
      quartile; relative log expression) and two meta-analytic algorithms (robust rank 
      aggregation; Fisher's method of p-value combining) were integrated into the 
      pipeline. Network analysis was conducted on miRNet 2.0 while enrichment and 
      over-representation analyses were conducted on miEAA 2.0. RESULTS: A total of 
      1256 DE-miRNAs (821 downregulated; 435 upregulated) were identified from 5 
      eligible miRNA seq datasets (3 circulatory; 1 adipose; 1 pancreatic). The 
      meta-signature comprised 9 miRNAs (hsa-miR-15b-5p; hsa-miR-33b-5p; 
      hsa-miR-106b-3p; hsa-miR-106b-5p; hsa-miR-146a-5p; hsa-miR-483-5p; 
      hsa-miR-539-3p; hsa-miR-1260a; hsa-miR-4454), identified via the two 
      meta-analysis approaches. Two hub nodes (hsa-miR-106b-5p; hsa-miR-15b-5p) with 
      above-average degree and betweenness centralities in the miRNA-gene interactions 
      network were identified. Downstream analyses revealed 5 highly conserved- 
      (hsa-miR-33b-5p; hsa-miR-15b-5p; hsa-miR-106b-3p; hsa-miR-106b-5p; 
      hsa-miR-146a-5p) and 7 highly confident- (hsa-miR-33b-5p; hsa-miR-15b-5p; 
      hsa-miR-106b-3p; hsa-miR-106b-5p; hsa-miR-146a-5p; hsa-miR-483-5p; 
      hsa-miR-539-3p) miRNAs. A total of 288 miRNA-disease associations were 
      identified, in which 3 miRNAs (hsa-miR-15b-5p; hsa-miR-106b-3p; hsa-miR-146a-5p) 
      were highly enriched. CONCLUSIONS: A meta-signature of DE-miRNAs associated with 
      T2D was discovered via in-silico analyses and its pathobiological relevance was 
      validated against corroboratory evidence from contemporary studies and downstream 
      analyses. The miRNA meta-signature could be useful for guiding future studies on 
      T2D. There may also be avenues for using the pipeline more broadly for evidence 
      synthesis on other conditions using high throughput transcriptomics.

TI  - Identification of a Novel Theranostic Signature of Metabolic and 
      Immune-Inflammatory Dysregulation in Myocardial Infarction, and the Potential 
      Therapeutic Properties of Ovatodiolide, a Diterpenoid Derivative.

AB  - Myocardial infarction (MI) is a multifactorial global disease, recognized as one 
      of the leading causes of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Timely and 
      correct diagnoses and effective treatments could significantly reduce incidence 
      of complications and improve patient prognoses. In this study, seven 
      unconventional differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (MAN2A2, TNFRSF12A, SPP1, 
      CSNK1D, PLAUR, PFKFB3, and CXCL16, collectively termed the MTSCPPC signature) 
      were identified through integrating DEGs from six MI microarray datasets. The 
      pathological and theranostic roles of the MTSCPPC signature in MI were 
      subsequently analyzed. We evaluated interactions of the MTSCPPC signature with 
      ovatodiolide, a bioactive compound isolated from Anisomeles indica (L.) Kuntze, 
      using in silico molecular docking tools and compared it to specific inhibitors of 
      the members of the MTSCPPC signature. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of the 
      public databases revealed high expression levels of the MTSCPPC signature in 
      immune cells of adult human hearts during an MI event. The MTSCPPC signature was 
      significantly associated with the cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions, 
      chemokine signaling, immune and inflammatory responses, and metabolic 
      dysregulation in MI. Analysis of a micro (mi)RNA regulatory network of the 
      MTSCPPC signature suggested post-transcriptional activation and the roles of 
      miRNAs in the pathology of MI. Our molecular docking analysis suggested a higher 
      potential for ovatodiolide to target MAN2A2, CSNK1D, and TNFRSF12A. Collectively, 
      the results derived from the present study further advance our understanding of 
      the complex regulatory mechanisms of MI and provide a potential MI theranostic 
      signature with ovatodiolide as a therapeutic candidate.

AB  - We investigated the role of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its 
      signaling pathway in the proinflammatory cytokines production of macrophages. The 
      effects of different concentrations of BDNF on proinflammatory cytokines 
      expression and secretion in U937 cell-differentiated macrophages, and human 
      monocyte-derived macrophages were analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
      assay and real-time polymerase chain reaction. The CRISPR-Cas9 system was used to 
      knockout p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR), one of the BDNF receptors. 
      Next-generation sequencing (NGS) was conducted to search for BDNF-regulated 
      microRNA. A very low concentration of BDNF (1 ng/mL) could suppress the secretion 
      of interleukin (IL)-1β, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and IL-6 in 
      lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophages but did not change their mRNA 
      expression. BDNF suppressed IL-1β and IL-6 secretion in human monocyte-derived 
      macrophages. In U937 cells, BDNF suppressed the phosphorylation of JNK and c-Jun. 
      The p75NTR knockout strongly suppressed IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α secretion in 
      macrophages and LPS-stimulated macrophages. BDNF regulated the expression of 
      miR-3168 with Ras-related protein Rab-11A as its target. In conclusion, BDNF 
      suppressed proinflammatory cytokines secretion in macrophages and inhibited the 
      phosphorylation of JNK. Knockout of p75NTR suppressed proinflammatory cytokines 
      expression and secretion. BDNF upregulated the expression of miR-3168. The 
      inhibition of p75NTR could be a potential strategy to control inflammation.

AB  - Non-coding RNAs have been shown to play important regulatory roles, notably in 
      cancer development. In this study, we investigated the role of microRNAs and 
      circular RNAs in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (NPC) by constructing a 
      circRNA-miRNA-mRNA co-expression network and performing differential expression 
      analysis on mRNAs, miRNAs, and circRNAs. Specifically, the Epstein-Barr virus 
      (EBV) infection has been found to be an important risk factor for NPC, and 
      potential pathological differences may exist for EBV+ and EBV- subtypes of NPC. 
      By comparing the expression profile of non-cancerous immortalized nasopharyngeal 
      epithelial cell line and NPC cell lines, we identified differentially expressed 
      coding and non-coding RNAs across three groups of comparison: cancer vs. 
      non-cancer, EBV+ vs. EBV- NPC, and metastatic vs. non-metastatic NPC. We 
      constructed a ceRNA network composed of mRNAs, miRNAs, and circRNAs, leveraging 
      co-expression and miRNA target prediction tools. Within the network, we 
      identified the regulatory ceRNAs of CDKN1B, ZNF302, ZNF268, and RPGR. These 
      differentially expressed axis, along with other miRNA-circRNA pairs we identified 
      through our analysis, helps elucidate the genetic and epigenetic changes central 
      to NPC progression, and the differences between EBV+ and EBV- NPC.

      Approach.

AB  - Epigenetic modifications are considered of utmost significance for tumor 
      ontogenesis and progression. Especially, it has been found that miRNA expression, 
      as well as DNA methylation plays a significant role in central nervous system 
      tumors during childhood. A total of 49 resected brain tumors from children were 
      used for further analysis. DNA methylation was identified with 
      methylation-specific MLPA and, in particular, for the tumor suppressor genes 
      CASP8, RASSF1, MGMT, MSH6, GATA5, ATM1, TP53, and CADM1. miRNAs were identified 
      with microarray screening, as well as selected samples, were tested for their 
      mRNA expression levels. CASP8, RASSF1 were the most frequently methylated genes 
      in all tumor samples. Simultaneous methylation of genes manifested significant 
      results with respect to tumor staging, tumor type, and the differentiation of 
      tumor and control samples. There was no significant dependence observed with the 
      methylation of one gene promoter, rather with the simultaneous presence of all 
      detected methylated genes' promoters. miRNA expression was found to be correlated 
      to gene methylation. Epigenetic regulation appears to be of major importance in 
      tumor progression and pathophysiology, making it an imperative field of study.

PG  - 100990
LID - 10.1016/j.mgene.2021.100990 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 is characterized by the elevation of a broad 
      spectrum of inflammatory mediators associated with poor disease outcomes. We 
      aimed at an in-silico analysis of regulatory microRNA and their transcription 
      factors (TF) for these inflammatory genes that may help to devise potential 
      therapeutic strategies in the future. METHODS: The cytokine regulating 
      immune-expressed genes (CRIEG) were sorted from literature and the GEO microarray 
      dataset. Their co-differentially expressed miRNA and transcription factors were 
      predicted from publicly available databases. Enrichment analysis was done through 
      mienturnet, MiEAA, Gene Ontology, and pathways predicted by KEGG and Reactome 
      pathways. Finally, the functional and regulatory features were analyzed and 
      visualized through Cytoscape. RESULTS: Sixteen CRIEG were observed to have a 
      significant protein-protein interaction network. The ontological analysis 
      revealed significantly enriched pathways for biological processes, molecular 
      functions, and cellular components. The search performed in the miRNA database 
      yielded ten miRNAs that are significantly involved in regulating these genes and 
      their transcription factors. CONCLUSION: An in-silico representation of a network 
      involving miRNAs, CRIEGs, and TF, which take part in the inflammatory response in 
      COVID-19, has been elucidated. Thus, these regulatory factors may have 
      potentially critical roles in the inflammatory response in COVID-19 and may be 
      explored further to develop targeted therapeutic strategies and mechanistic 
      validation.

TI  - Multiomics Identification of Potential Targets for Alzheimer Disease and Antrocin 
      as a Therapeutic Candidate.
LID - 10.3390/pharmaceutics13101555 [doi]
LID - 1555
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most frequent cause of neurodegenerative dementia 
      and affects nearly 50 million people worldwide. Early stage diagnosis of AD is 
      challenging, and there is presently no effective treatment for AD. The specific 
      genetic alterations and pathological mechanisms of the development and 
      progression of dementia remain poorly understood. Therefore, identifying 
      essential genes and molecular pathways that are associated with this disease's 
      pathogenesis will help uncover potential treatments. In an attempt to achieve a 
      more comprehensive understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of AD, we 
      integrated the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from six microarray datasets 
      of AD patients and controls. We identified ATPase H+ transporting V1 subunit A 
      (ATP6V1A), BCL2 interacting protein 3 (BNIP3), calmodulin-dependent protein 
      kinase IV (CAMK4), TOR signaling pathway regulator-like (TIPRL), and the 
      translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 70 (TOMM70) as upregulated DEGs 
      common to the five datasets. Our analyses revealed that these genes exhibited 
      brain-specific gene co-expression clustering with OPA1, ITFG1, OXCT1, ATP2A2, 
      MAPK1, CDK14, MAP2K4, YWHAB, PARK2, CMAS, HSPA12A, and RGS17. Taking the mean 
      relative expression levels of this geneset in different brain regions into 
      account, we found that the frontal cortex (BA9) exhibited significantly (p < 
      0.05) higher expression levels of these DEGs, while the hippocampus exhibited the 
      lowest levels. These DEGs are associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, 
      inflammation processes, and various pathways involved in the pathogenesis of AD. 
      Finally, our blood-brain barrier (BBB) predictions using the support vector 
      machine (SVM) and LiCABEDS algorithm and molecular docking analysis suggested 
      that antrocin is permeable to the BBB and exhibits robust ligand-receptor 
      interactions with high binding affinities to CAMK4, TOMM70, and T1PRL. Our 
      results also revealed good predictions for ADMET properties, drug-likeness, 
      adherence to Lipinskís rules, and no alerts for pan-assay interference compounds 
      (PAINS) Conclusions: These results suggest a new molecular signature for AD 
      parthenogenesis and antrocin as a potential therapeutic agent. Further 
      investigation is warranted.

TI  - Human microRNA similarity in breast cancer.

AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in a variety of human diseases, including 
      breast cancer. A number of miRNAs are up- and down-regulated in breast cancer. 
      However, little is known about miRNA similarity and similarity network in breast 
      cancer. Here, a collection of 272 breast cancer-associated miRNA precursors 
      (pre-miRNAs) were utilized to calculate similarities of sequences, target genes, 
      pathways and functions and construct a combined similarity network. 
      Well-characterized miRNAs and their similarity network were highlighted. 
      Interestingly, miRNA sequence-dependent similarity networks were not identified 
      in spite of sequence-target gene association. Similarity networks with minimum 
      and maximum number of miRNAs originate from pathway and mature sequence, 
      respectively. The breast cancer-associated miRNAs were divided into seven 
      functional classes (classes I-VII) followed by disease enrichment analysis and 
      novel miRNA-based disease similarities were found. The finding would provide 
      insight into miRNA similarity, similarity network and disease heterogeneity in 
      breast cancer.

TI  - Circulating microRNAs as biomarkers in bile-derived exosomes of 
      cholangiocarcinoma.
PG  - 140-150
LID - 10.4174/astr.2021.101.3.140 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: In this pilot study, using next-generation sequencing and integrated 
      messenger RNA (mRNA) sequencing, we investigated circulating microRNA (miRNA) 
      expression profiling from bile-derived exosomes to identify dysregulated miRNA 
      signatures and oncogenic pathways and determine their effects on targeted mRNAs 
      in cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). Moreover, we explored the possibility that genetic 
      analysis using bile-derived exosomes may replace gene analysis using tissue. 
      METHODS: Bile was collected from a patient with perihilar CCA before curative 
      resection. As a control, bile was collected from a patient with a common bile 
      duct stone. Exosomes were isolated from the bile, and we performed 
      next-generation miRNA sequencing using isolated exosomes. To evaluate miRNA-mRNA 
      interactions, mRNA sequencing was performed using bile fluid in both patients. 
      RESULTS: We identified 22 differentially expressed miRNAs. More than 65% of the 
      predicted mRNA targets of those miRNAs were actually differentially expressed 
      between control and CCA bile samples. In functional pathway analysis, targets of 
      22 miRNAs were primarily enriched in mitogen-activated protein kinase, platelet 
      derived growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, epidermal growth 
      factor receptor, and p53 signaling. In particular, in the functional assessment 
      of miRNA-mRNA interactions, RAS pathways, including downstream pathways 
      (PI3K-AKT-mTOR and RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK), were determined to be enriched. CONCLUSION: 
      Circulating miRNAs in bile-derived exosomes provide new information for the 
      development of miRNA analysis in CCA. These miRNAs may represent the oncogenic 
      characteristics of CCA tissue, enabling them to be used instead of tissue samples 
      for the diagnosis of CCA. Further research investigating circulating miRNAs in 
      bile exosomes may lead to more rational, targeted approaches to treatment.

      T-cell Lymphoma.
PG  - 6039-6053
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-21-0573 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) is a heterogeneous group of 
      non-Hodgkin lymphomas with aggressive clinical behavior. We performed 
      comprehensive miRNA profiling in PTCLs and corresponding normal CD4(+) Th1/2 and 
      TFH-like polarized subsets to elucidate the role of miRNAs in T-cell 
      lymphomagenesis. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We used nCounter (NanoString Inc) for miRNA 
      profiling and validated using Taqman qRT-PCR (Applied Biosystems, Inc). Normal 
      CD4(+) T cells were polarized into effector Th subsets using signature cytokines, 
      and miRNA significance was revealed using functional experiments. RESULTS: 
      Effector Th subsets showed distinct miRNA expression with corresponding 
      transcription factor expression (e.g., BCL6/miR-19b, -106, -30d, -26b, in 
      IL21-polarized; GATA3/miR-155, miR-337 in Th2-polarized; and TBX21/miR-181a, 
      -331-3p in Th1-polarized cells). Integration of miRNA signatures suggested 
      activation of TCR and PI3K signaling in IL21-polarized cells, ERK signaling in 
      Th1-polarized cells, and AKT-mTOR signaling in Th2-polarized cells, validated at 
      protein level. In neoplastic counterparts, distinctive miRNAs were identified and 
      confirmed in an independent cohort. Integrative miRNA-mRNA analysis identified a 
      decrease in target transcript abundance leading to deregulation of sphingolipid 
      and Wnt signaling and epigenetic dysregulation in angioimmunoblastic T-cell 
      lymphoma (AITL), while ERK, MAPK, and cell cycle were identified in PTCL subsets, 
      and decreased target transcript abundance was validated in an independent cohort. 
      Elevated expression of miRNAs (miR-126-3p, miR-145-5p) in AITL was associated 
      with poor clinical outcome. In silico and experimental validation suggest two 
      targets (miR-126→ SIPR2 and miR-145 → ROCK1) resulting in reduced RhoA-GTPase 
      activity and T-B-cell interaction. CONCLUSIONS: Unique miRNAs and deregulated 
      oncogenic pathways are associated with PTCL subtypes. Upregulated miRNA-126-3p 
      and miR-145-5p expression regulate RhoA-GTPase and inhibit T-cell migration, 
      crucial for AITL pathobiology.

AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important regulators of gene expression. The large-scale 
      detection and profiling of miRNAs have been accelerated with the development of 
      high-throughput small RNA sequencing (sRNA-Seq) techniques and bioinformatics 
      tools. However, generating high-quality comprehensive miRNA annotations remains 
      challenging due to the intrinsic complexity of sRNA-Seq data and inherent 
      limitations of existing miRNA prediction tools. Here, we present iwa-miRNA, a 
      Galaxy-based framework that can facilitate miRNA annotation in plant species by 
      combining computational analysis and manual curation. iwa-miRNA is specifically 
      designed to generate a comprehensive list of miRNA candidates, bridging the gap 
      between already annotated miRNAs provided by public miRNA databases and new 
      predictions from sRNA-Seq datasets. It can also assist users in selecting 
      promising miRNA candidates in an interactive mode, contributing to the 
      accessibility and reproducibility of genome-wide miRNA annotation. iwa-miRNA is 
      user-friendly and can be easily deployed as a web application for researchers 
      without programming experience. With flexible, interactive, and easy-to-use 
      features, iwa-miRNA is a valuable tool for the annotation of miRNAs in plant 
      species with reference genomes. We also illustrate the application of iwa-miRNA 
      for miRNA annotation using data from plant species with varying genomic 
      complexity. The source codes and web server of iwa-miRNA are freely accessible at 
      http://iwa-miRNA.omicstudio.cloud/.

AB  - The space radiation environment consists of multiple species of charged 
      particles, including (28)Si ions, that may impact brain function during and 
      following missions. To develop biomarkers of the space radiation response, BALB/c 
      and C3H female and male mice and their F2 hybrid progeny were irradiated with 
      (28)Si ions (350 MeV/n, 0.2 Gy) and tested for behavioral and cognitive 
      performance 1, 6, and 12 months following irradiation. The plasma of the mice was 
      collected for analysis of miRNA levels. Select pertinent brain regions were 
      dissected for lipidomic analyses and analyses of levels of select biomarkers 
      shown to be sensitive to effects of space radiation in previous studies. There 
      were associations between lipids in select brain regions, plasma miRNA, and 
      cognitive measures and behavioral following (28)Si ion irradiation. Different but 
      overlapping sets of miRNAs in plasma were found to be associated with cognitive 
      measures and behavioral in sham and irradiated mice at the three time points. The 
      radiation condition revealed pathways involved in neurodegenerative conditions 
      and cancers. Levels of the dendritic marker MAP2 in the cortex were higher in 
      irradiated than sham-irradiated mice at middle age, which might be part of a 
      compensatory response. Relationships were also revealed with CD68 in miRNAs in an 
      anatomical distinct fashion, suggesting that distinct miRNAs modulate 
      neuroinflammation in different brain regions. The associations between lipids in 
      selected brain regions, plasma miRNA, and behavioral and cognitive measures 
      following (28)Si ion irradiation could be used for the development of biomarker 
      of the space radiation response.

AB  - Molecular single cell analyses provide insights into physiological and 
      pathological processes. Here, in a stepwise approach, we first evaluate 19 
      protocols for single cell small RNA sequencing on MCF7 cells spiked with 1 pg of 
      1,006 miRNAs. Second, we analyze MCF7 single cell equivalents of the eight best 
      protocols. Third, we sequence single cells from eight different cell lines and 67 
      circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from seven SCLC patients. Altogether, we analyze 
      244 different samples. We observe high reproducibility within protocols and reads 
      covered a broad spectrum of RNAs. For the 67 CTCs, we detect a median of 68 
      miRNAs, with 10 miRNAs being expressed in 90% of tested cells. Enrichment 
      analysis suggested the lung as the most likely organ of origin and enrichment of 
      cancer-related categories. Even the identification of non-annotated candidate 
      miRNAs was feasible, underlining the potential of single cell small RNA 
      sequencing.

AB  - Which genes, gene sets or pathways are regulated by certain miRNAs? Which miRNAs 
      regulate a particular target gene or target pathway in a certain physiological 
      context? Answering such common research questions can be time consuming and labor 
      intensive. Especially for researchers without computational experience, the 
      integration of different data sources, selection of the right parameters and 
      concise visualization can be demanding. A comprehensive analysis should be 
      central to present adequate answers to complex biological questions. With 
      miRTargetLink 2.0, we develop an all-in-one solution for human, mouse and rat 
      miRNA networks. Users input in the unidirectional search mode either a single 
      gene, gene set or gene pathway, alternatively a single miRNA, a set of miRNAs or 
      an miRNA pathway. Moreover, genes and miRNAs can jointly be provided to the tool 
      in the bidirectional search mode. For the selected entities, interaction graphs 
      are generated from different data sources and dynamically presented. Connected 
      application programming interfaces (APIs) to the tailored enrichment tools miEAA 
      and GeneTrail facilitate downstream analysis of pathways and context-annotated 
      categories of network nodes. MiRTargetLink 2.0 is freely accessible at 
      https://www.ccb.uni-saarland.de/mirtargetlink2.

LID - 10.3390/cells10051066 [doi]
LID - 1066
AB  - Little is known about abundance level changes of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) 
      and messenger RNAs (mRNA) in patients with Ebstein's anomaly (EA). Here, we 
      performed an integrated analysis to identify the differentially abundant miRNAs 
      and mRNA targets and to identify the potential therapeutic targets that might be 
      involved in the mechanisms underlying EA. A large panel of human miRNA and mRNA 
      microarrays were conducted to determine the genome-wide expression profiles in 
      the blood of 16 EA patients and 16 age and gender-matched healthy control 
      volunteers (HVs). Differential abundance level of single miRNA and mRNA was 
      validated by Real-Time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Enrichment analyses of altered 
      miRNA and mRNA abundance levels were identified using bioinformatics tools. 
      Altered miRNA and mRNA abundance levels were observed between EA patients and 
      HVs. Among the deregulated miRNAs and mRNAs, 76 miRNAs (49 lower abundance and 27 
      higher abundance, fold-change of ≥2) and 29 mRNAs (25 higher abundance and 4 
      lower abundance, fold-change of ≥1.5) were identified in EA patients compared to 
      HVs. Bioinformatics analysis identified 37 pairs of putative miRNA-mRNA 
      interactions. The majority of the correlations were detected between the lower 
      abundance level of miRNA and higher abundance level of mRNA, except for 
      let-7b-5p, which showed a higher abundance level and their target gene, SCRN3, 
      showed a lower abundance level. Pathway enrichment analysis of the deregulated 
      mRNAs identified 35 significant pathways that are mostly involved in signal 
      transduction and cellular interaction pathways. Our findings provide new insights 
      into a potential molecular biomarker(s) for the EA that may guide the development 
      of novel targeting therapies.

TI  - High-Throughput Sequencing of BACHD Mice Reveals Upregulation of Neuroprotective

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a genetic disorder marked by transcriptional 
      alterations that result in neuronal impairment and death. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are 
      non-coding RNAs involved in post-transcriptional regulation and fine-tuning of 
      gene expression. Several studies identified altered miRNA expression in HD and 
      other neurodegenerative diseases, however their roles in early stages of HD 
      remain elusive. Here, we deep-sequenced miRNAs from the striatum of the HD mouse 
      model, BACHD, at the age of 2 and 8 months, representing the pre-symptomatic and 
      symptomatic stages of the disease. Our results show that 44 and 26 miRNAs were 
      differentially expressed in 2- and 8-month-old BACHD mice, respectively, as 
      compared to wild-type controls. Over-representation analysis suggested that 
      miRNAs up-regulated in 2-month-old mice control the expression of genes crucial 
      for PI3K-Akt and mTOR cell signaling pathways. Conversely, miRNAs regulating 
      genes involved in neuronal disorders were down-regulated in 2-month-old BACHD 
      mice. Interestingly, primary striatal neurons treated with anti-miRs targeting 
      two up-regulated miRNAs, miR-449c-5p and miR-146b-5p, showed higher levels of 
      cell death. Therefore, our results suggest that the miRNAs altered in 2-month-old 
      BACHD mice regulate genes involved in the promotion of cell survival. Notably, 
      over-representation suggested that targets of differentially expressed miRNAs at 
      the age of 8 months were not significantly enriched for the same pathways. 
      Together, our data shed light on the role of miRNAs in the initial stages of HD, 
      suggesting a neuroprotective role as an attempt to maintain or reestablish 
      cellular homeostasis.

AB  - Analyzing all features of small non-coding RNA sequencing data can be demanding 
      and challenging. To facilitate this process, we developed miRMaster. After the 
      analysis of over 125 000 human samples and 1.5 trillion human small RNA reads 
      over 4 years, we present miRMaster 2 with a wide range of updates and new 
      features. We extended our reference data sets so that miRMaster 2 now supports 
      the analysis of eight species (e.g. human, mouse, chicken, dog, cow) and 10 
      non-coding RNA classes (e.g. microRNAs, piRNAs, tRNAs, rRNAs, circRNAs). We also 
      incorporated new downstream analysis modules such as batch effect analysis or 
      sample embeddings using UMAP, and updated annotation data bases included by 
      default (miRBase, Ensembl, GtRNAdb). To accommodate the increasing popularity of 
      single cell small-RNA sequencing data, we incorporated a module for unique 
      molecular identifier (UMI) processing. Further, the output tables and graphics 
      have been improved based on user feedback and new output formats that emerged in 
      the community are now supported (e.g. miRGFF3). Finally, we integrated 
      differential expression analysis with the miRNA enrichment analysis tool miEAA.

TI  - Comprehensive Analysis of Expression Regulation for RNA m6A Regulators With 
      Clinical Significance in Human Cancers.
PG  - 624395
LID - 10.3389/fonc.2021.624395 [doi]
LID - 624395
AB  - BACKGROUND: N6-methyladenosine (m6A), the most abundant chemical modification on 
      eukaryotic messenger RNA (mRNA), is modulated by three class of regulators namely 
      "writers," "erasers," and "readers." Increasing studies have shown that aberrant 
      expression of m6A regulators plays broad roles in tumorigenesis and progression. 
      However, it is largely unknown regarding the expression regulation for RNA m6A 
      regulators in human cancers. RESULTS: Here we characterized the expression 
      profiles of RNA m6A regulators in 13 cancer types with The Cancer Genome Atlas 
      (TCGA) data. We showed that METTL14, FTO, and ALKBH5 were down-regulated in most 
      cancers, whereas YTHDF1 and IGF2BP3 were up-regulated in 12 cancer types except 
      for thyroid carcinoma (THCA). Survival analysis further revealed that low 
      expression of several m6A regulators displayed longer overall survival times. 
      Then, we analyzed microRNA (miRNA)-regulated and DNA methylation-regulated 
      expression changes of m6A regulators in pan-cancer. In total, we identified 158 
      miRNAs and 58 DNA methylation probes (DMPs) involved in expression regulation for 
      RNA m6A regulators. Furthermore, we assessed the survival significance of those 
      regulatory pairs. Among them, 10 miRNAs and 7 DMPs may promote cancer initiation 
      and progression; conversely, 3 miRNA/mRNA pairs in kidney renal clear cell 
      carcinoma (KIRC) may exert tumor-suppressor function. These findings are 
      indicative of their potential prognostic values. Finally, we validated two of 
      those miRNA/mRNA pairs (hsa-miR-1307-3p/METTL14 and hsa-miR-204-5p/IGF2BP3) that 
      could serve a critical role for potential clinical application in KIRC patients. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlighted the importance of upstream regulation 
      (miRNA and DNA methylation) governing m6A regulators' expression in pan-cancer. 
      As a result, we identified several informative regulatory pairs for prognostic 
      stratification. Thus, our study provides new insights into molecular mechanisms 
      of m6A modification in human cancers.

AB  - Advanced sequencing technologies such as RNASeq provide the means for production 
      of massive amounts of data, including transcriptome-wide expression levels of 
      coding RNAs (mRNAs) and non-coding RNAs such as miRNAs, lncRNAs, piRNAs and many 
      other RNA species. In silico analysis of datasets, representing only one RNA 
      species is well established and a variety of tools and pipelines are available. 
      However, attaining a more systematic view of how different players come together 
      to regulate the expression of a gene or a group of genes requires a more 
      intricate approach to data analysis. To fully understand complex transcriptional 
      networks, datasets representing different RNA species need to be integrated. In 
      this review, we will focus on miRNAs as key post-transcriptional regulators 
      summarizing current computational approaches for miRNA:target gene prediction as 
      well as new data-driven methods to tackle the problem of comprehensively and 
      accurately dissecting miRNome-targetome interactions.

TI  - Visceral Adipose Tissue of Prediabetic and Diabetic Females Shares a Set of 
      Similarly Upregulated microRNAs Functionally Annotated to Inflammation, Oxidative 
      Stress and Insulin Signaling.
LID - 10.3390/antiox10010101 [doi]
LID - 101
AB  - Hypertrophic and hypoxic visceral adipose tissue (VAT) secretes proinflammatory 
      cytokines promoting insulin resistance (IR), prediabetes and type 2 diabetes 
      (T2DM) microRNAs (miRNAs) are markers of metabolic disorders regulating genes 
      critical for e.g., inflammation, glucose metabolism, and antioxidant defense, 
      with raising diagnostic value. The aim of the current study was to evaluate 
      whether hyperglycemia is able to affect the expression of selected miRNAs in VAT 
      of prediabetic (IFG) and diabetic (T2DM) patients vs. normoglycemic (NG) subjects 
      using qPCR. Statistical analyses suggested that miRNAs expression could be 
      sex-dependent. Thus, we determined 15 miRNAs as differentially expressed (DE) 
      among NG, T2DM, IFG females (miR-10a-5p, let-7d-5p, miR-532-5p, miR-127-3p, 
      miR-125b-5p, let-7a-5p, let-7e-5p, miR-199a-3p, miR-365a-3p, miR-99a-5p, 
      miR-100-5p, miR-342-3p, miR-146b-5p, miR-204-5p, miR-409-3p). Majority of 
      significantly changed miRNAs was similarly upregulated in VAT of female T2DM and 
      IFG patients in comparison to NG subjects, positively correlated with FPG and 
      HbA1c, yet, uncorrelated with WHR/BMI. Enrichment analyses indicated involvement 
      of 11 top DE miRNAs in oxidative stress, inflammation and insulin signaling. 
      Those miRNAs expression changes could be possibly associated with low-grade 
      chronic inflammation and oxidative stress in VAT of hyperglycemic subjects.

TI  - Specific MiRNAs in naïve T cells associated with Hepatitis C Virus-induced 
      Hepatocellular Carcinoma.
PG  - 1-9
LID - 10.7150/jca.49594 [doi]
AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common type of cancer and the 
      second leading cause of cancer-associated mortality worldwide. Hepatitis C virus 
      (HCV) infection is the primary cause of hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis, which in 
      turn, notably increase the risk of developing HCC. The systematic immune response 
      plays a vital role in protecting eukaryotic cells from exogenous antigens. In the 
      present study, to determine the association between T cells and miRNAs in 
      HCV-induced HCC (HCV-HCC), bulk mRNA and miRNA sequencing data from HCV-HCC 
      tissues were combined, along with single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data from 
      T cells. Deconvoluted bulk RNA-seq data and miRNA profiles enabled the 
      identification of naive CD4+ T cell-associated miRNAs, which may help to 
      elucidate the underlying mechanism of the anti-HCV immune response. Using bulk 
      RNA-seq data, the current analysis presents a feasible method for assessing the 
      relationship between miRNAs and cell components, providing valuable insights into 
      the effects of T cell-associated miRNAs in HCV-HCC.

TI  - Cellular, Extracellular and Extracellular Vesicular miRNA Profiles of 
      Pre-Ovulatory Follicles Indicate Signaling Disturbances in Polycystic Ovaries.
LID - 10.3390/ijms21249550 [doi]
LID - 9550
AB  - Cell-free RNAs have the potential to act as a means of gene expression regulation 
      between cells and are therefore used as diagnostic markers describing the state 
      of tissue environment. The origin and functions of such RNAs in human ovarian 
      follicle, the environment of oocyte maturation, are unclear. The current study 
      investigates the difference in the microRNA profiles of fertile women and 
      polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients in three compartments from the same 
      preovulatory follicle: mural granulosa cells (MGC), cell-free follicular fluid 
      (FF), and extracellular vesicles (EV) of the FF by small RNA sequencing. In 
      silico analysis was used for the prediction and over-representation of targeted 
      pathways for the detected microRNAs. PCOS follicles were distinguished from 
      normal tissue by the differential expression of 30 microRNAs in MGC and 10 
      microRNAs in FF (FDR < 0.1) that commonly regulate cytokine signaling pathways. 
      The concentration of EV-s was higher in the FF of PCOS patients (p = 0.04) 
      containing eight differentially expressed microRNAs (p < 0.05). In addition, we 
      present the microRNA profiles of MGC, FF, and EV in the fertile follicle and 
      demonstrate that microRNAs loaded into EVs target mRNAs of distinct signaling 
      pathways in comparison to microRNAs in FF. To conclude, the three follicular 
      compartments play distinct roles in the signaling disturbances associated with 
      PCOS.

TI  - CoolMPS: evaluation of antibody labeling based massively parallel non-coding RNA 
      sequencing.
PG  - e10
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkaa1122 [doi]
AB  - Results of massive parallel sequencing-by-synthesis vary depending on the 
      sequencing approach. CoolMPS™ is a new sequencing chemistry that incorporates 
      bases by labeled antibodies. To evaluate the performance, we sequenced 240 human 
      non-coding RNA samples (dementia patients and controls) with and without CoolMPS. 
      The Q30 value as indicator of the per base sequencing quality increased from 91.8 
      to 94%. The higher quality was reached across the whole read length. Likewise, 
      the percentage of reads mapping to the human genome increased from 84.9 to 86.2%. 
      For both technologies, we computed similar distributions between different RNA 
      classes (miRNA, piRNA, tRNA, snoRNA and yRNA) and within the classes. While 
      standard sequencing-by-synthesis allowed to recover more annotated miRNAs, 
      CoolMPS yielded more novel miRNAs. The correlation between the two methods was 
      0.97. Evaluating the diagnostic performance, we observed lower minimal P-values 
      for CoolMPS (adjusted P-value of 0.0006 versus 0.0004) and larger effect sizes 
      (Cohen's d of 0.878 versus 0.9). Validating 19 miRNAs resulted in a correlation 
      of 0.852 between CoolMPS and reverse transcriptase-quantitative polymerase chain 
      reaction. Comparison to data generated with Illumina technology confirmed a known 
      shift in the overall RNA composition. With CoolMPS we evaluated a novel 
      sequencing-by-synthesis technology showing high performance for the analysis of 
      non-coding RNAs.

AB  - Aging is a key risk factor for chronic diseases of the elderly. MicroRNAs 
      regulate post-transcriptional gene silencing through base-pair binding on their 
      target mRNAs. We identified nonlinear changes in age-related microRNAs by 
      analyzing whole blood from 1334 healthy individuals. We observed a larger 
      influence of the age as compared to the sex and provide evidence for a shift to 
      the 5' mature form of miRNAs in healthy aging. The addition of 3059 diseased 
      patients uncovered pan-disease and disease-specific alterations in aging 
      profiles. Disease biomarker sets for all diseases were different between young 
      and old patients. Computational deconvolution of whole-blood miRNAs into blood 
      cell types suggests that cell intrinsic gene expression changes may impart 
      greater significance than cell abundance changes to the whole blood miRNA 
      profile. Altogether, these data provide a foundation for understanding the 
      relationship between healthy aging and disease, and for the development of 
      age-specific disease biomarkers.

AB  - For many research aspects on small non-coding RNAs, especially microRNAs, 
      computational tools and databases are developed. This includes quantification of 
      miRNAs, piRNAs, tRNAs and tRNA fragments, circRNAs and others. Furthermore, the 
      prediction of new miRNAs, isomiRs, arm switch events, target and target pathway 
      prediction and miRNA pathway enrichment are common tasks. Additionally, databases 
      and resources containing expression profiles, e.g., from different tissues, 
      organs or cell types, are generated. This information in turn leads to improved 
      miRNA repositories. While most of the respective tools are implemented in a 
      species-independent manner, we focused on tools for human small non-coding RNAs. 
      This includes four aspects: (1) miRNA analysis tools (2) databases on miRNAs and 
      variations thereof (3) databases on expression profiles (4) miRNA helper tools 
      facilitating frequent tasks such as naming conversion or reporter assay design. 
      Although dependencies between the tools exist and several tools are jointly used 
      in studies, the interoperability is limited. We present HumiR, a joint web 
      presence for our tools. HumiR facilitates an entry in the world of miRNA 
      research, supports the selection of the right tool for a research task and 
      represents the very first step towards a fully integrated knowledge-base for 
      human small non-coding RNA research. We demonstrate the utility of HumiR by 
      performing a very comprehensive analysis of Alzheimer's miRNAs.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a class of neurodevelopmental disorders 
      characterized by genetic and environmental risk factors. The pathogenesis of ASD 
      has a strong genetic basis, consisting of rare de novo or inherited variants 
      among a variety of multiple molecules. Previous studies have shown that microRNAs 
      (miRNAs) are involved in neurogenesis and brain development and are closely 
      associated with the pathogenesis of ASD. However, the regulatory mechanisms of 
      miRNAs in ASD are largely unclear. In this work, we present a stepwise method, 
      ASDmiR, for the identification of underlying pathogenic genes, networks, and 
      modules associated with ASD. First, we conduct a comparison study on 12 miRNA 
      target prediction methods by using the matched miRNA, lncRNA, and mRNA expression 
      data in ASD. In terms of the number of experimentally confirmed miRNA-target 
      interactions predicted by each method, we choose the best method for identifying 
      miRNA-target regulatory network. Based on the miRNA-target interaction network 
      identified by the best method, we further infer miRNA-target regulatory bicliques 
      or modules. In addition, by integrating high-confidence miRNA-target interactions 
      and gene expression data, we identify three types of networks, including 
      lncRNA-lncRNA, lncRNA-mRNA, and mRNA-mRNA related miRNA sponge interaction 
      networks. To reveal the community of miRNA sponges, we further infer miRNA sponge 
      modules from the identified miRNA sponge interaction network. Functional analysis 
      results show that the identified hub genes, as well as miRNA-associated networks 
      and modules, are closely linked with ASD. ASDmiR is freely available at

TI  - Seq-SymRF: a random forest model predicts potential miRNA-disease associations 
      based on information of sequences and clinical symptoms.
PG  - 17901

LID - 17901
AB  - Increasing evidence indicates that miRNAs play a vital role in biological 
      processes and are closely related to various human diseases. Research on 
      miRNA-disease associations is helpful not only for disease prevention, diagnosis 
      and treatment, but also for new drug identification and lead compound discovery. 
      A novel sequence- and symptom-based random forest algorithm model (Seq-SymRF) was 
      developed to identify potential associations between miRNA and disease. Features 
      derived from sequence information and clinical symptoms were utilized to 
      characterize miRNA and disease, respectively. Moreover, the clustering method by 
      calculating the Euclidean distance was adopted to construct reliable negative 
      samples. Based on the fivefold cross-validation, Seq-SymRF achieved the accuracy 
      of 98.00%, specificity of 99.43%, sensitivity of 96.58%, precision of 99.40% and 
      Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.9604, respectively. The areas under the 
      receiver operating characteristic curve and precision recall curve were 0.9967 
      and 0.9975, respectively. Additionally, case studies were implemented with 
      leukemia, breast neoplasms and hsa-mir-21. Most of the top-25 predicted 
      disease-related miRNAs (19/25 for leukemia; 20/25 for breast neoplasms) and 15 of

AB  - miRNAs are important regulators of gene expression that play a key role in many 
      biological processes. High-throughput techniques allow researchers to discover 
      and characterize large sets of miRNAs, and enrichment analysis tools are becoming 
      increasingly important in decoding which miRNAs are implicated in biological 
      processes. Enrichment analysis of miRNA targets is the standard technique for 
      functional analysis, but this approach carries limitations and bias; alternatives 
      are currently being proposed, based on direct and curated annotations. In this 
      review, we describe the two workflows of miRNAs enrichment analysis, based on 
      target gene or miRNA annotations, highlighting statistical tests, software tools, 
      up-to-date databases, and functional annotations resources in the study of 
      metazoan miRNAs.

AB  - Soon after birth, the regenerative capacity of the mammalian heart is lost, 
      cardiomyocytes withdraw from the cell cycle and demonstrate a minimal 
      proliferation rate. Despite improved treatment and reperfusion strategies, the 
      uncompensated cardiomyocyte loss during injury and disease results in cardiac 
      remodeling and subsequent heart failure. The promising field of regenerative 
      medicine aims to restore both the structure and function of damaged tissue 
      through modulation of cellular processes and regulatory mechanisms involved in 
      cardiac cell cycle arrest to boost cardiomyocyte proliferation. Non-coding RNAs 
      (ncRNAs), such as microRNAs (miRNAs), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and 
      circular RNAs (circRNAs) are functional RNA molecules with no protein-coding 
      function that have been reported to engage in cardiac regeneration and repair. In 
      this review, we summarize the current understanding of both the biological 
      functions and molecular mechanisms of ncRNAs involved in cardiomyocyte 
      proliferation. Furthermore, we discuss their impact on the structure and 
      contractile function of the heart in health and disease and their application for 
      therapeutic interventions.
